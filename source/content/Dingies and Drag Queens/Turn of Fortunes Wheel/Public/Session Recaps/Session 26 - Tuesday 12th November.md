You started the session with your arrival at Eagle's Aerie, a community of awakened birds and other flying creatures suspended hundreds of feet above the forest floor on great redwood trees. The community consisted of multiple nests and birds houses. You clambered and climbed your way up to a bird house and knocked, answered by a less than hospital giant eagle who was tending to her chicks. You asked about Parvaz, the leader of the birds, and were eventually directed to Watcher's Talon where he holds court with his counsel. 

Watcher's Talon was a 2 hour walk away, so you set to it. Eventually arriving, you were met with a giant, petrified tree. Augh'er climbed up and requested the presence of Parvaz, who begrudgingly agreed and flew down to meet the rest of your party. 

Parvaz recognised Bawk and joked that he didn't expect for him to live long enough after they last met. He knew nothing of Oka's death and didn't particularly care. The Vile Hunt rarely bothered him and his followers. He did, however, know where they camp, but saw no reason to share the information. It did not benefit him, so you would have to make it worth his while. You eventually struck a deal, he would share the location and would send agents after you to see if you had procured anything of interest to him. 

You all left, seething in your dislike for him. You headed back to Ophelia and Ebonclaw, recruiting Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Wolfway and Jeremy Clarkson the wolves, and Derek and Steven the rhinos.

With your army at hand, you marched upon the Vile Hunt's camp. A fight of course ensued. The kenkus had their lives flash before their eyes as the druid impaled them all on a wall of thorns, but managed to survive. Derek, however, was not as lucky, getting mind controlled and falling to the thorns. 

Jeremy Clarkson tragically fell to a wall of fire, which was close to being the fate for Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Wolfway, saved only by the tears of Augh'er (and healing from Kazaan). Steven came out in pretty good shape, all things considered. 

During the fight, a gnoll released a caged triceratops who rampaged through the fight. You learned that this triceratops was Trixy, the friend of Slimy Silvia that you were asked to find. You also found the missing Roc egg, and plenty of loot. 

You have a few remaining jobs in Faunel; you can return to Ebonclaw and Ophelia to be rewarded in gems. Ophelia also promised a figurine of wondrous power. You can return Trixy to Slimy Silvia, who will then give a discount on her products. Kazaan also can return to Zendri Cork, the potion trader in Camp Greenbriar, to pick up his potion of necrotic resistance for a further 200gp. And of course, you can return word to Thistle's patron, who can then begin helping you repair the Walking Castle.
