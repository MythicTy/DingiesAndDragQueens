You started the session by not so subtly searching for Beltha, resulting in a fight with one of their associates. After winning, you convinced them to take you to where Beltha was hiding.

You struck a deal with Beltha, she would get you to the gate in exchange for the logbook back.

Working with one of her associates, Bawk and Augh'er snuck into the Concordant Express station. Unfortunately, Augh'er was arrested, requiring Bawk to talk him out of jail.

After filling in the information into the Mimir, Bawk and Augh'er returned to Uthal and Thistle, who had been perusing the logbook.

You learnt many things from the Logbook, including dates of when the Modron March left Mechanus, as well as R04M leaving Mechanus a few years later, marked as an "Adventurer and Investigator". You had also taken notes of these logs.

You also learnt that Beltha and her crew stole the logbook to investigate a member of the council of order, named Isthil, in relation to shipments of Doomguard weaponry into Automata, being held in a warehouse in town. Isthil had been routinely meeting a Doomguard member on the Concordant Express, the logbook was the evidence for it.

You left Automata, bound for Excelsior, and later Tradegate and Faunel. The travel would take 15 days.

On your travels, you came across a lone Knight, travelling to slay a hag and rescue kidnapped children. It would be a minor detour, so you agreed to assist. Which is where we pick back up.
