Thlaarsh led a gang of fiends and tieflings to attack [[The Walking Castle]] in chase of [[R04M]]. They were following [[Shemeshka]]'s bounty, but when he escaped they decided to take the castle instead. He snuck up on your group and impaled Thistle with his claws. Despite this, you bested him. But who knows, fiends don't truly die unless they die in the hells.
