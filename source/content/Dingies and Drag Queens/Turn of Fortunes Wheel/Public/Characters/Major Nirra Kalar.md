Nirra is a hobgoblin woman, bound by duty and holding herself to high esteem. She hails from [[Rigus]], the gatetown to Acheron. You met her in [[The Market Ward|The Great Bazaar]], in [[The Market Ward|A Major Issue]].

She stood up to [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Uthal]], who she clearly had history with, and accosted him for attempting to tax her men at some point previous.

You do not know much more about her.
