You met Clocksworth in Sigil as you explored the City.

> A modron sits on its knees in the middle of the street, obsessively counting cobblestones. People pass by it without a glace, accept for a few who angrily huff and swerve around as the busy automaton refuses to move or even acknowledge passers-by.

> The modron mumbles to itself: "One two, three... three by three is nine, by three again... why do they come in sets of three...?"

He's a lost member of the [[The Great Modron March]], which left 189 years earlier than it should have. You collectively decided to keep him. Notably, he commented that you all looked like you'd seen other modrons.

He is now a travelling companion of yours. In [[Automata]], you encountered a [[The Glitch|glitching]] version of [[The Great Modron March]] that culminated in you fighting a [[The Glitch|glitching]], fiendish, beholder-aboleth creature. After the fight, Clocksworth swore an Oath of Vengeance to help his fellow modrons and kill any aberration that would stand in his way.
