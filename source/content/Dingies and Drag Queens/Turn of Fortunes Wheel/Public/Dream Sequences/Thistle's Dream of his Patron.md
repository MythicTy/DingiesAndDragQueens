> Despite the fact that Warforged do not sleep, whilst you still experience these strange dreams whilst you rest in your inactive, motionless state. You are entreated once again by the familiar night time visions of a crystal. Your motion is heavy and thick, like being trapped in resin. Your surroundings are pink and red. The colours ebb and flow peacefully. Its silent, save for an itch in the back of your skull. You hear the itch, its like someone is scratching the base of your skull, or someone is breathing down your neck. Its almost as if... someone is faintly whispering in your ear. This feeling is both known and unknown. Familiar, yet unfamiliar. Its a sending spell, but it can't quite reach you.

> The ebb and flow of the surroundings begins to whip up, turning orange and red. It cracks and lights up like distant thunder, and the strikes ring in your ears. Your body shakes with each impact.

> The voice is familiar, usually its calm and gentle, it is not this time. She speaks with urgency in her voice. "Can't reach you, can't teleport you, you're missing. Invaders, poachers, fire. Return. Please."

> Thunder cracks again to your left and your thrown to the side, starting awake. You're lying on the cold floor of the walking castle. Lightning strikes again and the walls of the castle shake and you're tossed to the other side as the floor begins to tip. These are not lighting strikes, they're explosions.
