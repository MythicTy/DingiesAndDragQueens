# Entering Automata

![[05-06 Concord Terminus.png]]

> Rigid beings move purposefully through Automata’s perfect street grid. Most travel in sync with the reverberating rhythm of the great, toothed gear that rises like an arch at the gate-town’s centre. As you near the community, your mimir rattles energetically, and the glow in its eye sockets pulses in time with the pervasive ticking.

You arrived in Automata first, after travelling in [[The Walking Castle]] for a handful of days. You set to work looking for [[R04M]] and getting directions to the gate. As you did this, you encountered a [[The Glitch|glitching]] version of [[The Great Modron March]] which clogged up the traffic in Automata.

> You begin to hear a feint, rhythmic thud of footsteps, in tune with the great cog that rotates in the distant centre of automata. After a moment, you begin to see a large procession of modrons, marching through the streets of Automata, towards the front gate that you just passed through moments ago. After a few more moments, the line of modrons marches past you, out of the gate and into the Outlands.

> Its at this point that Clocksworth chirps up, excitedly announcing "It's the Modron March! We found them!" He rushes up to them, excitedly waving to them. But they bear no response to him, no notice at all.

Upon closer inspection, the modrons all seemed to be terrified of something, looking around in fear. The source of this fear is unknown. 
# Missile
> As the march progresses, a figure, taller that the rest, comes into view. They are no modron - they are twice the height. They are not brass nor bronze, but instead mahogany wood with various leaves, and they march aimlessly alongside these modrons as if they are one of them.

This was [[Missile]], a 4th variant of [[Thistle]], who had [[The Glitch|glitched]] into existence. [[Thistle]], confused, began interacting with his variant and pulling him out of the march.
# Grim, Flint, and Augh'er
As [[Thistle]] interacted with [[Missile]], the rest of you heard commotion coming from round the corner.

> Over the rhythmic stomping of the march of modrons next to you, you hear a rough voice coming from a shallow side street.

> "Oh don't worry, we'll kill ya quick like before the merry band of misfits gets 'ere. Can't have you flapping your fins in support of 'em, easier to deal with ya's when your separated."

> As you round the corner, you see three figures. One is a 4 foot 10, well built Locathah with moist, sage green skin and reddish fins. One lone whisker comes down from his mouth, mirrored on the other side with a stump, suggesting a second that's missing. Close to you stands a big, brawny half orc, with rough grey skin and intricate tattoos covering his bald head. His tusks are long, and have expensive gold tips to them. At the far end of the street, flanking the Locathah, is a well dressed purple tiefling with a fire tattoo covering one side of his face. Both are equipped with hour glasses filled with golden sand hanging from their waists. The tiefling, leaning on a golden rod, notices you, rolls his eyes and says, "Speaking of the devils, here they come." He unleans from his staff, tossing it up and catching it, before pointing it at you. "Could you not have taken longer to get here? Let us finish up our business first?"

> The half orc turns to take notice of you as well, pulling out a golden mace from his waist band and slamming it into his open palm.

You were treated by [[Grim and Flint]] harassing [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Augh'er]] and threatening to kill him again. This was your first interaction with these three, and it quickly devolved into combat. Bawk got crushed into the ground, but otherwise you won the fight and [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Augh'er]] joined your party.
# Glitching Aboleth
> You begin to feel a rumbling. The ground shifts a bit, and all the nearby lights go out, including those carried by the legion of modrons, leaving you only with the anti-peak light let off by the spire in the distance. The fear on the faces of the nearby modrons greatens, and you begin to feel fuzzy, as if your glitch is worsening.

The party then began to see their greatest fears. Uthal saw a spectator, and Kazaan a visage of Baahl. This was merely was an illusion cast by the creature, which was revealed shortly after.

> You see the source of the spell as its tendrils snake around the corner of the nearest building. Its slimy, long tongue slithering its way towards those under the effects of the spell. Its gaping maw, lined in a circle with sharp, yellow teeth, form almost a smile. As it comes into view more clearly, you can see the creature's body. Purplish, red skin covers its form, with numerous tendrils ending in fins and flippers. Along the centre of its back, more fins, as if this creature were an aquatic being. At its head, three vertically aligned, cloudy pink eyes make eye contact with the affected. From the side of its head sprouts 4 stalks, each with the same eyes at the end, which point at each of you. Various fiendish horns and spines protrude from its body, especially near its head.

> The modrons see this creature too, and begin to disperse, glitching out of existence.

You learned over the course of the fight that this creature was an Aboleth, but one that had possibly been tainted by various planar energies. It's skin was partially incorporeal and grey whilst in dim light, as if touched by the Grey Wastes of Hades. After a long fight, you managed to finish the creature, with none other than [[Clocksworth]] landing the killing blow. It was here that he swore his Oath of Vengeance to help his fellow modrons and kill any aberration that would stand in his way.
# The Gate
> A forest of stanchions creates a mile-long path to the great mechanized gate at Automata’s center. Hundreds of travelers stand in queue, seeking to pass through the gate to Mechanus. Amid the line, modron overseers orchestrate the orderly, sluggish procession to the gate.

The crushing bureaucracy of Automata meant it would take numerous days to get to the gate. You waiting in line, only to be turned away without the correct documents. The line for the correct documents took an extra day, and filling out the tower of documents took another. Finally, you turned in the documents, only to find that you had made a mistake and had to redo them all over again. Bawk killed himself. Thankfully, [[Aristimus]], the captain of Automata's guards and a member of the town's ruling body, the Council of Order, noticed your ordeal and offered you a solution. 

> “l don’t see the harm in admitting you to the gate. Of course, I'll have to convince the rest of the Council of Order of your intentions. If you take care of something that’s been vexing us, though, that gesture of good faith could make all the difference. “There are discordant elements operating in Automata. One such individual is an outlaw named Beltha. She recently stole one of the logbooks for the Concordant Express. It contains timetables, passenger lists, manifests, and more. Recover the logbook, and I'll see to it that you can use the gate as you require. And if you bring Beltha in, I'll throw in a bonus.”

And so you set off to the Inverse to find [[Beltha]]. You were made aware that she had a distinctive cog tattoo and a hideout in The Inverse.
# The Inverse

![[05-05 The Inverse.png]]
The chaotic underbelly to Automata, The Inverse is literally inverted. It's gravity flips you upside down. It was here that [[Bawk]] discovered his love of oil, permanently becoming oily. 
## The Kenku
Whilst here, the party where accosted by three kenku who were very interested in stealing [[The Mosaic Mimir]]. They mimicked your words to confuse you before attempting to steal it. Uthal sliced the thief in one swing. [[Bawk]], taken aback by his kin being slaughtered, inspired the remaining two kenku to rally and kill Uthal and Kazaan. Kazaan got thunderwaved into the roiling cogs below. Uthal managed to kill one of the kenku and [[Bawk]], before himself falling to the cogs and dying, leaving a single kenku alive. 
## Hat
You encountered a green slaad who was enamoured by Bawk's pink hat, and kept trying to steal it, following your group before you gave him an adequate replacement hat.
## "The Glitch Is Nigh!"
You came across a small modron holding a cardboard sign that read "[[The Glitch]] Is Night!" He chanted that "The Great Multiversal Alignment is coming!" You asked him what he meant, and he picked up a ball and threw it, it glitching back to his hand.
## Taken to Court
> Approaching behind you, you hear a chaotic arrangement of footsteps. You turn round to see 3 pentadrones and a decaton modron, the same amount and type as guarding the gate above, but much less organised.

> "Surface dwellers, we allow no agents of order down here, and as such, you are required to make your plea in front of the Council of Anarchy for why we should allow you to continue. You shall now follow us."

Begrudgingly, you followed to the Council of Anarchy, a three story government building that twists and turns as it extends upwards. Three pillars made of gears that twist and turn in random and weird placements held the roof up.

> The guards lead you through two big, arched doors, leading into a large, court like room. A septon modron, a decaton modron, and a githzerai sit at the front 3 seats, with a jury off to the right with all assortments of people. The guards gesture to a stand where a human with hot pink hair quickly stands up to greet you. He introduces himself as your Council appointed representative, Gary.

The prosecution was none other than the surviving kenku from earlier, claiming to have been ruthlessly attacked and robbed of his Mosaic Mimir. Gary told the party that the council and jury favour the more absurd party, so to just go as far as they could. Then the kenku started his opening statement.

> "Your honours, I, but a mere humble Kenku, was ruthlessly attacked by this gang of delinquents, as we were merely collecting gears for... uh... resurrecting Vecna. They stole my Mimir, and left me battered and injured. They even murdered my friends!"

> The Septon modron pipes up. "That seems reasonable, defendants, what do you offer as explanation?

The party claimed that they couldn't possibly have been there because they were golfing with the dead three, among other statements, that eventually won them the case.
## Beltha
As you left court, you saw a gith woman bearing a distinctive cog tattoo - [[Beltha]]. You chased her to her hideout, where you fought her. She managed to escape. It was also here that [[Bawk]] was implanted by a Slaad Tadpole, later to burst from his chest, becoming [[Sal the Slaad]]. You continued your search for [[Beltha]], getting into a fight with her associates, before getting her location. You managed to cut a deal with her, she would help you reach the gate, and she would keep [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Notable Items/The Concord Express Logbook|The Logbook]]. 

After getting to the gate, [[Bawk]] getting [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Augh'er]] arrested, you returned to [[Beltha]]. She let you look through [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Notable Items/The Concord Express Logbook|The Logbook]] and take notes from it, and she told you of how she had stolen it as evidence against a member of the Council of Order's corruption. This member's name was [[Councillor Isthil|Isthil]], and they regularly made trips on the Concord Express (the train that takes passengers through the gate to Mechanus) and return the same day. She discovered, through the logbook, that he would always travel with a person called [[Cornelus]], a member of the [[Doomguard]]. 

[[Beltha]] had also been stealing shipments from the [[Doomguard]] that had been coming into Automata, evidenced by the crates in her safehouse. She told you that the [[Doomguard]] have a warehouse in Automata, but you didn't investigate. [[Dingies and Drag Queens/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Notable Items/The Concord Express Logbook|The Logbook]] contained other useful information, which you can read about in it's entry.
