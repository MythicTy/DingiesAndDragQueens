> The gatetown to Bytopia brings a slice of Sigil's Market Ward, without the cutthroat competition of capitalism, or the shady back markets of the Hive Ward. Tradegate is a town of industrious labourers and gentle traders, buzzy plazas and quaint boutiques, and quiet crafts and wild inventions.

> The steady flow of people entering the gatetown splits off in two. One group head straight towards the markets, and another towards a large stone stronghold with cobalt decorations to the building. A large sign sits at the top of this structure; "Trademill Mint. Can't shop without Lodestars!"

As you entered Tradegate, you quickly learnt that you must swap your currency over to Lodestars in order to be served by the traders. You travelled to the Trademill Mint to do this.
# Trademill Mint
> As you approach, the building begins to come into focus atop the horizon of market stalls and shops. A stone fortress lined with cobalt decorations. Guards walk atop the battlements of this high security building.

> Double front doors open out into an ornately decorated room with a blue and white tile floor depicting a set of scales. One side of the scales shows stacks of coins, and the other side showing box and crates and bags. 3 guards stand watch around the edge of the room, each equipped with a spear.

> The room breaks off into multiple queue lines leading towards bank teller style booths. People pass over all manner of currencies and gems, in exchange for an equivalent mass of blue cobalt coins, those you would recognise from trading with the Tortles a number of weeks ago. These coins are called Lodestars, and are the staple currency of Tradegate.

As your begun exchanging currencies, the ground began to rumble as a [[Xorn]] glided through the floor, looking to do his shopping.

> As you reach into your pack to retrieve your valuables, you feel the earth rumble and shake behind you. You turn around to witness a bizarre creature emerge from the stone tile flooring at the centre of the room. It doesn't burst through the floor like a burrowing mole, but rather gliding out of it like a fish glides through water. The creature itself seems to be wrought from stone, and has a body shaped like a clay pot, with a mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth on the top. It trundles across the floor with three clawed feet, and scratches at its bulbous body with a three clawed hand, before bellowing out in a rough, but slightly piteous voice.

> "Xorn is HUNGRY! Xorn has come to purchase your shinies!" The creature plods over to the wall next to the bank tellers, before smoothly entering the stone wall and disappearing into it.

The creature was going for the vault, looking to "shop". The guards sprinted after it, you in tow. You found it inside the vault, scooping gems and gold into it's mouth. The guards attempted to stop it, but it just swatted their spears out of their hands. It then eventually escaped, gliding smoothly through the floor of the vault downwards.

# Xorn Is Hungry!
You were joined by [[Baristus Silver]], who exclaimed that it was the 3rd time this week. He hired your party to get to the bottom of this. It was in your best interest to, since you couldn't shop without converting your currency, and the Mint was closed until the Xorn situation was dealt with.

You went to Manyroads' Maps, a tower owned by [[Melvin Manyroads]], to discover if there were any cave systems below the town.

> Manyroads' Maps is a tall, turquoise tower with a marigold roof. The middle of the tower pinches inward, resembling your classic, stereotypical wizard's tower.

There were indeed cave systems beneath the town, so you set off to explore them.

## The Caves Beneath Tradegate
One of the first things you encountered down here was a mimic doing a crossword. He asked you all for help solving it, and for the most part you did; except 2. 

- "Factol of the Heralds of Dust, (5) down."
- "Popular White Dragon musician, well known for his debut performance in Fortune's Wheel, (11) across."

The next room you visited had a statue of the Xorn and 2 earth elementals. There was a communication issue between you, so naturally you killed them. They dropped a gemstone that was shaped like a key that opened a portal in the statue. This portal took you to a garden of similar statues and the [[Xorn]]'s home. 

> You find yourself in a massive cavern, in what you can only assume is the Elemental Plane of Earth. This magical land almost seems to fold into itself, where the sky is ground and the ground is sky. But, these two halves are not mirror images, instead they are two separate places on the same plane.

> Gravity feels weird here, like it could shift at a moments notice, like it ebbs and flows like the wind.

> You stand at a three legged, three armed statue. A line of similar statues stretch along a dirt path that leads towards a cave a small distance off. Each statue striking a different pose, such as flexing its arms or pulling a Usain Bolt pose. Dozens more of these statues scatter the nearby terrain.

The [[Xorn]]'s home was decorated using rocks and cave painting carved like furniture. In the [[Xorn]]'s room was posters of bands such as Copperback, Guns and Boulders, and Adolescent Metal.

The [[Xorn]] welcomed you to his home, offering you magic rocks to eat. Augh'er accepted. The [[Xorn]] also told you about how he made a deal with a small fellow who wore many shiny and tasty looking jewels and gems. His name began with an "Era-" but he didn't remember properly. The deal was that he could "shop" at the Mint whenever he wanted, and he was given a small compass to follow to find it. 

You returned this information to [[Baristus Silver]], who confirmed that there was a member of the Trademill Mint's board called [[Erasimus Astralbeard]] who owned a mansion in town. He was also a member of the town's Parliament but was out of town. You also discovered that the [[Xorn]]'s Compass pointed to a gem in the vault.
## Erasimus' Mansion
His mansion was being protested as he owned a private vault that allowed him to be insulated from the Xorn attacks. He wasn't doing anything to stop the attacks, either.

> The mansion is a sprawling estate set on several acres of meticulously landscaped grounds, complete with manicured lawns, ornate gardens, and a private lake round the back. The exterior of the mansion is grand, with a blend of classical architecture and modern luxury. Tall, white marble columns support a grand entrance with double oak doors, intricately carved with gold accents. Large, arched windows line the faÃ§ade, allowing natural light to pour into the expansive rooms within.

> A wooden front porch stretches two thirds of the front side, two armed guards stand watching for trespassers. A cobblestone path lines the right side of the house, circling around the curved glass front ballroom. A stone and metal fence lines the outside of the estate.

You broke into his mansion looking for clues, murdering your way through his private guard. You also found his private vault, but not the code to it. You eventually found that the code was easy to guess on a letter in a safe, but to get into the safe required you to hurl it out the window which triggered an alarm spell put on the window.

Your lack of subtlety alerted the town guard. You escaped into the forest surrounding Tradegate. 

The following day, the mansion was swarming with Town Guard. Thistle acted as a distraction, causing a chunk of Guard to follow him away from the mansion. He shot one guard and then blew himself, killing another.

You snuck back in, and after toiling through the many traps and defences of the vault, you opened it to discover it filled with dozens of Compass Gems, similar to the one you found in the Mint's vault. You also discovered two letters. 

> Dear Erasimus,

> I hope the shipment of compass gems has reached you well. When connected to a compass they will point to the gem. Even the bluntest of rocks can follow the direction.

> Best of luck, your sponsor.
---
> To Members of Parliament,

> I am writing to address the recent shrinkage in the members present in our government. The current economic situation and Xorn attacks are causing a squeeze on both citizen and MP alike. Those who rely on the Trademill Mint to store their wealth suffer the most, and a few MPs now don't own enough wealth to meet the requirements to continue being members. The inaction and, in some cases, steps taken to block this issue being dealt with is disgusting. It is not just I that realises this, the public protests are a clear mandate from the people that something must be done. I remind you of the oath you took to act in the best interest of Tradegate, and currently you are not. The only way we solve the unrest is dealing with this issue, failure to do so will only hurt the people more. Please act.

> From, MP Garet Flair.

Escaping wasn't the most subtle either, with Kazaan tripping and alerting a guard. 
## Erasimus' Questioning
The remaining party members who hadn't been spotted returned to [[Baristus Silver]] and brought the evidence to him. It was enough to bring [[Erasimus Astralbeard|Erasimus]] in for questioning, who admitted to it. He had getting the Xorn to siphon off money from the vault. Since you need a certain amount of wealth to be a member of parliament, this would likely leave him as one of the few ruling Tradegate as he was insulated due to his private vault. 

You did not discover who his sponsor was. 
## Scrying
It was during this segment that you discovered you were being scried upon. When you questioned [[Erasimus Astralbeard|Erasimus]], he assured you it wasn't him, even under a Zone of Truth.
# Bawk's Genie Contract
[[Bawk]] was tasked with killing [[Kabril Sahaar]] for [[Aslan Ashfang]] in [[The Lower Ward|The Armoury]]. You arrived at his shop, Windwaker Weaponry, and were greeted by the genie.

> The shop is shaped like a stereotypical genie lamp, with a large sign above the door labelling it as "Windwaker Weaponry"

> Entering the shop, you feel a light breeze. The air is cool and fresh inside. Columns of weaponry line the walls of this small shop, from glaives to sickles to bows, each uniquely decorated with various symbols depicting wind, storms, etc. Each shine with a slight blue tint.

> As you gawk at the selection, the wind in the room begins to whip and pick up, swirling like a cyclone centred behind the counter. The wind coalesces into the form of a pale blue skinned man. He exudes pride and aristocracy, with a white turban and an impressive black beard. His chest is exposed, covered only by sleeveless, open red vest. On his person are multiple daggers secured around his waist, a scimitar on his back and one holstered to his hip. He stands holding an ornate spear with a red standard hanging from it.

[[Bawk]] started a fight which [[Kabril Sahaar]] quickly ended, murdering him. Uthal and Kazaan forced the genie to retreat into his vessel where he quickly healed and returned. Bawk, having respawned, decided to be diplomatic and attempt to negotiate with the genie. He tasked you with destroying a [[Doomguard]] warehouse and returning to him. Once you had done that, he would agree to talk to you.

> The Doomguard are not subtle about their contempt for rival competition. You are not the first, and I doubt you'll be the last. However, you can deal a pretty hurtful blow to them and it would get them off my back for a while. They head a warehouse in Tradegate. You're welcome to cause a scene big enough that I'll notice from here, or you do something quietly and bring me back proof. The warehouse is your sandbox.
## Doomguard Warehouse
The warehouse was an imposing compound surrounded with barbed wire fences and numerous guards. [[Bawk]] decided to infiltrate, disguising himself as an inspector and talking his way in, as Uthal and Kazaan waited outside. He discovered that the warehouse was storing weaponry imported from [[The Lower Ward|The Armoury]] and [[Muspelforge]], and that there were many similar warehouses in [[Excelsior]], [[Automata]], [[Ribcage]], and [[Plague-mort]]. They were receiving shipments regularly due to high production at the time. 

Looking to blow the place up, Bawk set off a bomb using some smokepowder aquired earlier in the day, leaving half of the warehouse smouldering. Uthal and Kazaan then rushed in to destroy more of the warehouse, starting a fight. Bawk respawned and joined in. 
## Returning to the Genie
[[Kabril Sahaar]] thanked you for the service, and upgraded one of [[Bawk]]'s scimitars. He also offered to assist in killing [[Aslan Ashfang]] and gave Bawk a sending stone to contact him with. He warned to contact him before you returned to Sigil, as he could not teleport to you if you were in Sigil. 

> "My, my. You actually survived. Perhaps there is an opportunity for us to work together after all. But first, my gratitude for dealing with the Doomguard. They do not like competition, and I do not like their competition."
