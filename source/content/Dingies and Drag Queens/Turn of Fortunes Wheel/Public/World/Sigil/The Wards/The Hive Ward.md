# The Mortuary
## Morgue
> You start awake on a metal examination table in a dim, windowless stone chamber. You don't need to sleep, so you're not used to waking up.

> The air is cold and stale, tinged with the acrid sting of formaldehyde emanating from a nearby shelf of clouded flasks and antiseptic jars. You can hear pained moans haunting the halls beyond this stuffy room.

> Dried blood stains the drab, mosaicked floor, but not the edges of your table. It's more of an oil that has dried. Chunks of living wood, copper, bronze, and other materials you suspect have been removed from you surround the table. Examination equipment, different tools, goggles, a saw, all litter the various trollies and tables around your table

> Your head pounds like the worst hangover you've ever had, and your chest burns with a searing pain. You check yourself, and you're intact, no visible damage, despite what the surroundings would suggest

> You look around to see 7 more bodies laid on the tables around you. You watch for a moment to see if they too are alive, and you can see the faint rising and falling of their chests to indicate that some of them are

You started the campaign here, starting awake on various cold stone tables and hurting with various pains. 

The Mortuary is the home of the [[Heralds of Dust]], who process the city's dead and deceased. You were clearly one of them before you awoke. You met [[Morte]] here, who was merely here to fornicate with the various corpses and undead here.

## Autopsy Room
Moving through, you encountered [[Jex]], who screamed that you should be dead, awakening her Flesh Golem where she had dropped her keys into. 

> This sterile chamber reeks of embalming fluids. A mortician in a bloodstained apron hunches over a humanoid amalgam of patchwork flesh. Elbow deep in its flayed-open chest with a pair of surgical instruments, this grim doctor causes the corpselike creature to twitch and writhe with her movements.

Your first death happened here, Uthal getting his skull caved in by the aforementioned flesh golem. In reaction to Uthal glitching and returning back, Bawk offed himself.
## Possessions Room
You entered this room to see 2 poltergeists playing with Bawk's dead corpse. Thistle was encouraged to come up and perform, to middling reactions from the crowd of 3 skeletons.
## Cold Lockers
Bawk glitched back to life as a janitor around the corner near the Cold Lockers, where the Heralds of Dust stored their zombie workers. You awoke a few of them, but dispatched of them and earned some treasure.
## Crematorium
The only way forward was through the Crematorium hallway - horrible design, I know. 

> An ashy broom and dustpan lean against the wall out-side a narrow corridor with an iron, windowed door. Two levers - a blue lever in the upward position and a red lever turned downward - are set into the walls adjacent to the door. An identical door stands closed at the end of the passageway.

Due to bad decisions, Uthal got trapped in the hallway and scorched by Maurice the zombie. Surprisingly, he didn't die and firmed it.

## Corpse Retrieval
> A metal chute is set into the wall of this foul chamber. Grisly puddles spatter the floor, and corpses topple from an overturned cart.

One of the corpses disgorged a hostile Black Pudding. Uthal was crushed by falling corpses here. Bawk was also dissolved by the Black Pudding
## Dining Hall
> An ornate chandelier hangs over this lavish dining hall, Empty, high-backed chairs with decorative cushions sit beofer several covered platters.

> A ghostly butler rises from the floor before you, a decanter of ruby-red wine in its hand. The spirit speaks in a hollow voice, "Dinner is served".

The butler served you all lavish meals of your choosing. When eaten, they burnt your stomach and almost killed those who consumed them.
## Records Room
> A floating feline skull with gemstone eyes hovers above an aged desk strewn with elegant stationary. Deep in thought, the skull chews a black fountain pen in its ink-stained, bony fangs. A sea of crumpled papers is strewn through the chamber, and dusty scrolls line pigeonholes along the walls.

From one artist to another, Bawk encouraged Thaeziagnuz, the resident eulogist and demilich poet, and helped him finish the eulogy he was writing. 

You also found your death certificates here, interestingly lacking causes of death.
## Burial Grove
The last room you entered, and swiftly exited.

> Snow blankets this quiet, indoor grove of icy brambles. Carcasses worn by time lie partially buried in the sleet and ice. A skeletal, black barked tree looms over the gloomy orchard. Its branches bear a single fruit.

You left the Mortuary, heading for the surface of the Hive Ward.

![[01-02 Mortuary Domes.png]]
# Entering The Hive Ward
> You emerge from the Mortuary into a dilapidated city square. Stacks of jumbled tenements - grimy hodge-podges of lopsided architecture joined by rickety bridges - look over the persisten, low-hanging fog.

> An impossible city unflolds around you. Bladed buildings rise on all sides, the urban sprawl spreading along the inside of a gigantic torus. The metropolitan ring curves upward into the passing clouds, disappearing behind the haze.

> You exit into a square in the Hive Ward. Due to neglect from the Dabus and the Lady of Pain, the Ward has fallen into disrepair. Buildings are lopsided hodgepodges of architectural styles and materials, floors haphazardly stacked atop one another to conserve space. Crooked high rises darken cramped alleys, many of which are dead ends in more ways than one.

You encountered [[Parisa]] here, who offered to show you around the city for a small fee. 

> Its daunting isn't it? The sudden feeling that everything and everywhere are now at your fingertips. Don't worry, I won't lead you astray. Where do you want to go first?

# The Grease Pit
>  The flavours of the multiverse converge at the Grease Pit, a noisy alley brimming with planar street food. Creatures come from far and wide to sample its delights or hawk them to hungry customers over the hubbub of the daily crowds.

> All manner of scents caress your nostrils. You can hear the sizzling of meat skewers from a nearby stall, boasting about how its oil is taken straight from the battlefields of Acheron. A nearby fiend roasts mystery meat above a blazing fire. A mind flayer salts massive abyssal chicken kebabs before passing them to a salivating ogre.

# The Gatehouse
> The Gatehouse, the home of the Bleak Cabal and a fortress of rehabilitation and renewal. The tiered, ivory sanctuary rests on a hill at the end of Bedlam Run, a curved road that rises to meet the entrance. Calming fountains cascade over its chalk white balconies, which radiates from the central tower.

You visited here after invited by [[Pugdug]] in an attempt to help you with your [[The Glitch|Glitch]]. The Gatehouse is the home of the Bleak Cabal, and is full of community kitchens, hospital wards, and rest sites for the sick, injured, and afflicted.
