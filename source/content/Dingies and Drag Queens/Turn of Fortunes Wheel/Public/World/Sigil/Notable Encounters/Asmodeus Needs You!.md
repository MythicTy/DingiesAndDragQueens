> You pass by a small building with heavily armoured, horned devil standing outside. The fiend is roaring about all the benefits of enlisting in the Infernal Legions to join in the blood War.

> "Asmodeus Needs You!" He loudly accosts passers-by, warning them of all the jink and fame the sods are missing out on. "We even just got a new shipment of Sinker weaponry, we're only outfitted with the best!"

This devil accosted you all, getting you to sign your souls across to [[The Blood War]]. He bragged about getting new [[Doomguard]] weaponry for the Blood War. You of course stole back the contracts.
