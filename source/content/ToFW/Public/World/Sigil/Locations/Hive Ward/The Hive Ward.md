> You emerge from the Mortuary into a dilapidated city square. Stacks of jumbled tenements - grimy hodge-podges of lopsided architecture joined by rickety bridges - look over the persisten, low-hanging fog.

> An impossible city unflolds around you. Bladed buildings rise on all sides, the urban sprawl spreading along the inside of a gigantic torus. The metropolitan ring curves upward into the passing clouds, disappearing behind the haze.

> You exit into a square in the Hive Ward. Due to neglect from the Dabus and the Lady of Pain, the Ward has fallen into disrepair. Buildings are lopsided hodgepodges of architectural styles and materials, floors haphazardly stacked atop one another to conserve space. Crooked high rises darken cramped alleys, many of which are dead ends in more ways than one.

You encountered [[Parisa]] here, who offered to show you around the city for a small fee. 

> Its daunting isn't it? The sudden feeling that everything and everywhere are now at your fingertips. Don't worry, I won't lead you astray. Where do you want to go first?
