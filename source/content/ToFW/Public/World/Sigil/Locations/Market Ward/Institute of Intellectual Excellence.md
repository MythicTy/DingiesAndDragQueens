You travelled here to meet [[Enoll Eva]], the academy's dean. You entered during a lecture of her's on How Belief May Shape The Planes.

> Many great philosophers of the city have pondered the relationship between worshippers and their gods. The Athar believe that the Gods are merely powerful mortals, yet curiously Gods grow and fade, as do their clergy. Aoskar is thought to be no more.

> Just as belief in the Hands of Havok grows their ideals, can such not be the case with the Gods? Maybe Aoskar died because people believed he had died. Therefore, can the same not be case with our reality? If enough believe in something, that thing may manifest.

> For your next assignment, you will go away and research this theory. Perhaps you may discuss what the many factions have to say on this matter. Your deadline is in 37 days and 87 minutes. Dismissed.

She had no clue why you were all glitching and has never seen anything related. She could only surmise that it may be tied to the energy of the planes or some time travel related things.

She also commented that weird things have been happening recently, such as the [[The Great Modron March]] leaving 189 years ahead of schedule, a strange occurrence for beings of absolute law.
