Fought Doomlord Abraxis, who just toyed with you, forcing you to run, or die.

Bawk made a deal with the Efreeti shopkeeper of the Doomlord, agreeing to kill a Djinn called Kabril Sahaar, in exchange for power and assistance dealing with Abraxis.

Bawk and Thistle escaped, returning to the Ubiquitous Wayfarer, where you met Farrow who's employer had a job for you, in exchange for helping you escape the city streets.

Dodging the Harmonium, you escaped into Undersigil, where you came across a bloated rat.

Without hesitation, Kazaan stomped the rat, angering the swarm.

Proceeding without resting, you came across a peculiar dinner party, which Uthal and Kazaan quickly angering by not showing proper manners. You dispatched them, only to discover that they were infected by Vargouille Reflections. We pick up in the aftermath of that fight, with Bawk dead once again.
