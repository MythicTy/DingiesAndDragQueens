Came across a rat rave playing the hit banger radioactive by imagine dragons.

Happened across Sirus, Doomlord Kazaan's advisor, who gifted him the Devotee's Censer.

Brawled it out with Sire Oliver the Twisted, and acquired the Periapt of Wound Closure.

You surfaced in the Lady's Ward, where you travelled to the Fortune's Wheel.

You gambled all of your savings away, apart from Thistle who actually made a profit.

Uthal got pickpocketed by Vecna Impersonators.

Bawk and Thistle started a metal band with Winter's Bite, a drunk, angry white dragon who was down on his luck.

You were offered a job by the casino's proprietor, to find the rogue modron accountant, R04M, in exchange for an upfront payment of 300gp each and the promise of digging up information on the party. She passed you a blue lapis portal key that leads to the outlands, and suggested that you start your search in Automata.

You left, dodging a Harmonium patrol, and coming across Felik, a ghostly petitioner being interogated by a Mercykiller Bloodhound about his father's location.

And finally, you made it to the rearing horse statue, which is where we pick up.
