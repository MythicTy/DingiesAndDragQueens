At the start of the session, the castle began to bow with the thud of something large landing on it. The time dragon Renespurah, a supposed time long friend, coming to check up on her companions. She referred to you all by name, asked Thistle how Iris was after "what happened", before realising that she may not have met you yet in this timeline. She apologised as she could not elaborate, before gifting you a talisman of the sphere and telling you to give it to "the one who sees silver", before departing.

Later on in the journey, Bawk finally got a reaction out of his hilt, and then later receiving a vision in his dream. A dream of many variants getting pulled into the hilt of the blade to form a double bladed scimitar. The vision took him to a landscape of golden sands, starry skies, and draining hourglasses.

You then finally reached the hag's lair. Surrounding inhabitants were being controlled by strange crowns of thorns. Wolves, a dryad, and even another hag.

You rescued them all, and convinced the hag, who only speaks giant, to help you kill night hag in control of everything, which is where we pick back up.
