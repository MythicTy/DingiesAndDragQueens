The session began back with Bawk, Uthal, and Augh'er trapped at the home of the Xorn. The Xorn summoned his mother, a Dao genie, to make a new key, which set you back 200gp.

Returning to the Mint and conveniently meeting Thistle and Kazaan, you learnt of a member of Parliament and board member of the Trademill Mint, Erasimus Astralbeard, who happened to be a dwarf. He owned a mansion on the edge of town, but was out for a business trip.

The party travelled to the mansion, coming across a protest outside against the inaction for the reason Xorn attacks and how it was damaging the economy. But of course Astralbeard felt no effects because of his private vault. He was also a member of parliament, and to become a member you must own 500,000gp or more.

You decided to break in, waiting until the night to attempt to get in. Your plans all failed, so you said fuck it and stormed the place, killing 4 guards and knocking out 2 others. You managed to make your way to an office, which contained a letter from a concerned citizen, a golden statue of Erasimus, and a locked safe you have still yet to open.

You explored most of the rest of the house, with a small chunk left to explore, but yet to find a vault.

Thistle decided to go and finish off the 2 knocked out guards. In the process alerting another, but managed to talk his way out of it. Unfortunately, Thistle divulged the location of the rest of the party, and the guard ran off to alert the rest of the remaining guards.

Which is where we pick back up, with everyone trapped in a room with a single doorway.
