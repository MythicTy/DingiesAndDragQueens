We started the session with general downtime activities. Uthal did some training, Kazaan communed with Bhaal, Bawk did some research in the library, and Thistle went bird watching, and didn't see any birds, or much of anything, really.

You also talked to Zaythir and learned more about Iedcaru.

The first encounter of the journey happened when you noticed a large procession of a few hundred Tortles on a great pilgrimage to Thebestys. They were scholar, travelling in the name of knowledge and research. You traded with them for a few items, and then carried on.

The next couple day went by fine, until Bawk, out on the balcony, noticed the spire in the centre of the outlands crumbling and shattered, Sigil floating at an odd angle. This continued for a few hours, before it glitched back to normal.

We ended the session with an encounter with a Wild Magic Storm, where 3 Wild Magic Elementals descended on the castle. The fight was tough, but what was tougher was the Wild Magic Surges inflicted upon Bawk and Thistle. Bawk was subjected to turning permanently blue, spewing bubbles from his mouth, levitating, blinking to the Astral Plane for 6 seconds, and then plummeting to his near death where he was promptly put out of his misery by Uthal and Kazaan.

Thistle suffered a similar fate, casting Confusion on himself, which caused him to turn hostile on Kazaan. At the same time, one of Bawk's Wild Magic Surges made everyone vulnerable to slashing damage, causing Kazaan to be downed in one hit. Retaliating, he killed Thistle, which was his first death of the campaign, and where we pick up again.
