You started the session by tracking down a Hand of Havoc with a matching tattoo to Beltha's. You caught him, beat him up, stole his hammer, and was told to "look between the cogs" to find Beltha.

You travelled to the inverse, where you encountered a band of 3 Kenku, who took a shining to the Mosaic Mimir. Kazaan launched a guiding bolt through one of the Kenku's chests. Bawk, in retaliation, thunderwave-ed Kazaan to his death in the machinery below, before rallying the other two Kenku to slay Uthal. Bawk died, then Uthal slammed into a wall and also plummeted to his death, leaving one Kenku standing.

You all came back, and came across a modron chanting about how the Glitch is Nigh and how the Great Multiversal Alignment is coming.

You were then arrested, and taken to the Court of Discord, where you had to plead your case against the remaining Kenku in the most ridiculous was possible. You failed, and had to pay the Kenku.

Upon leaving, you saw a suspiscious Githzerai woman with a broken cog tattoo. You made chase, but she slipped away between two cogs, stealing Bawk's bag in the process. You caught up to her, and fought her and her allies, but she slipped away again. During the fight, Bawk took a hit from a Red Slaad, impregnating him with a Slaad Tadpole. He has a month.

Finally, you ended the session sleeping at a tavern, which is where we pick up again.
