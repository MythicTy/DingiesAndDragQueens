You started the session by finishing off the Genie quest, with Bawk being gifted a fancy new Scimitar (that I hope you've read and understood the description of) and being told to notify the Genie when you return to Sigil as he will help you kill Aslang Ashfang in the Armoury.

Returning to the Walking Castle, Bawk went into "labour". A slaad tadpole burst out of his chest. Long story short, Bawk is now co-parenting with Thistle to raise it. Of note, it will now be roughly teenager age.

You received a letter off of Shemeshka, notifying you of the progress, or lack of, that she had made towards uncovering your pasts.

A few days later, you saw a silhouette of another Walking Castle, followed by painful earthquakes that killed most of you. One thing you guys didn't pick up on was that after the Glitch, the surroundings were littered with dead Sunflies.

Uthal and Kazaan returned, instantly starting a fight with Bawk and Thistle over their past betrayals. Uthal one-turned them.

On day 19 / 22, Thistle had a dream. The dream started out like they usually do, trapped in crystal. The dream progressed, with the background resembling worsening thunder and lightning. Thistle received a sending spell from a familiar voice, pleading that she cannot reach him or teleport him, and that there are invaders and fire, begging him to return.

He was then startled awake to the revelation that it was not thunder, but rather explosions.
