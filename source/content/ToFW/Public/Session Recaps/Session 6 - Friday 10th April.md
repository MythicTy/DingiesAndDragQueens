You started off the session getting dumped off in the Outlands with no sense of direction or bearing, other than a distant view of the Spire and a set of mechanic footprints.

Following the footprints, you happened across a castle infested with fiends in search of a certain rogue modron accountant.

Fighting them off and clearing the castle, you rescued Zaythir, the castle's caretaker. Indebted to you, she offered you it as a home, revealing that the castle could, in fact, walk.

She also informed you of R04M, who had travelled to the castle and asked her to fix a Mosaic Mimir, claiming it to be "the key to saving my friends". He was quickly driven off by the fiends, and his wearabouts now are anyone's guess.

Zaythir asked you to hear R04M out when you find him, but otherwise agreed to help repair the Mimir. To do so, you must attune to it and take it to a list of gatetowns and bring it near to the gates and describing your experiences with the town to it. This will fill in the missing information, unlocking whatever secrets the mimir may hold.

We pick up with Iedcaru en route to Automata.
