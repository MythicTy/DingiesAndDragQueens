After finally finishing the Xorn questline, you were free to go shopping. Bawk bought himself some new armour, and more importantly, a Tradegate Tote Bag. When you put your hand into the bag, you produce a furry ball that, when thrown, summons a random creature (summons the same creature, so you can keep Smokey the Bear. If you roll the same number twice, reroll).

You then visited the Genie that Bawk had to kill. Despite previously informing me that his intentions were to make a deal with this Genie, he started the combat with a Dissonant Whisper to the dome. The Genie retaliated by summoning an air elemental and stabbing Bawk to death. Uthal and Kazaan got him low, but he managed to escape.

Moving upstairs, you found his lantern. You attempted to destroy it, but he came out to stop you, having fully healed. This prompted Bawk to attempt to make a deal. The Genie would have you blow up a Doomguard Warehouse, and then he would consider a deal with you.

You of course had to get explosives, and luckily a fella in Tradegate could hook you up. You bought some smoke powder, in exchange for some gold and a furry ball from the Tote. You then Long Rested and headed to the Warehouse under nightfall. Bawk disguised himself and talked his way in, discovering documents mentioning other Warehouses in Automata, Excelsior, Ribcage, and Plague-mort. The shipments of weapons also came from Muspelforge, the previous Citadel of Kazaan.

Satisfied, Bawk blew himself up.

Uthal and Kazaan then stormed the Warehouse, looking to finish the job, alerting the guards. Bawk returned just in time to re-join the fight. You finished the fight, which is where we come back, stood in front of a burning warehouse. It is possible to get to the back of the warehouse with minimal burns if you wish, or you can leave and head back to the Genie. What're you doing?
