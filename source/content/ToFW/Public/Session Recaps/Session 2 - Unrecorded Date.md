- Met Pugdug, a member of the Bleak Cabal, and visited the Gatehouse where you met Althax Darkfleece, who, after witnessing Bawk get his arm chopped off and die from bloodloss, and Thistle continuously scrape bark off of his body, theorised that the multiverse is trying to erase you, and something is recreating you.
- Sent a squeak to Enoll Eva of the Institute of Intellectual Excellence
- Visited Fell's Tattoos, where Fell recognised Uthal.
- Visited the Grease Pit for some otherwordly cuisine
- Went in to the Hall of Records, the home of the Fated, and dug through the records, which revealed the names of some acquaintances of Uthal's, and some records of Kazaan and being an ex-Doomlord. You also stole some documents from there.
- And finally, you went to rest at the Ubiquitous Wayfarer, which has portals to it from all over Sigil. Parissa agreed to meet you in the bar in the morning, and then Thistle ordered an entire keg of alcohol, and promptly passed out in your room, which is where we pick up.
