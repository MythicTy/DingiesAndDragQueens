1. Mortuary
2. Exploring Sigil with their Tout, maybe some encounters that reference their characters in the past
3. Eventually run in with Harmonium trying to arrest them after getting into enough Shenanigans, escape into Undersigil and make their way to Fortune's Wheel
4. Shemeska agrees to help them find out about their pasts if they find a "rogue accountant" for them, R04M. Told to start in Automata since he's a Modron
5. Make their way to Automata, on their way, run in with the Walking Castle
6. Help out Walking Castle, told that R04M passed through recently, receive Mosaic Mimir
7. Adventure through gate towns, retracing R04M's steps
8. During gate town segments, Renee subplot is woven in
	1. Along with the Fated and Doomguard subplot
	2. In Faunel, Parvaaz and Thistle's patron may uncover some of the grand plot
9. After filling in the Mosaic Mimir, party are sent to the rilmani settlement of Dendradis to find R04M
10. Find R04M in Darkweaver
11. Major Difference: R04M left Mechanus as a rogue modron in search of the lost X01 Legion, and hired the adventurers to scout possible locations. Shemeshka caught wind of this and assassinated them in Gzemnid's Realm, causing them to start glitching.
	1. R04M knows that something is wrong in the heart of Mechanus, possibly with the Primus, but doesn't know what
	2. Jumped by Shameshka's assassins looking to kill the party and R04M
	3. Maybe Farrow
12. Party confront Shameshka, she explains that she had the party assassinated, but they kept coming back. She captured them inside the Resplendent Cage, but they came back, albiet weaker and with fractured memories. She had them incapacitated and dumped in the Mortuary. She also explains her plot.
13. Fight, hopefully incapacitated, dumped and locked in Carceri.
	1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/turnoffortuneswheel/comments/18in71x/ideas_to_extend_the_final_act_of_the_adventure/](https://www.reddit.com/r/turnoffortuneswheel/comments/18in71x/ideas_to_extend_the_final_act_of_the_adventure/)
14. By the time the party escapes, R04M has been killed and the Outlands is overrun with the Blood War, along with the Modrons of Mechanus.
	1. Maybe run a combat, people fighting in the blood war are equipped with Doomguard weaponry
15. Party run in with an NPC, somehow encouraged to visit Renee for help to revert time
16. Meet Renee, who takes them before Chronepsis who agrees to help them this once as a means to right the balance disrupted by Shameshka.
17. Chronepsis also explains how the characters don't truly exist, but it is the belief of the Modron legion that is constantly reincarnating them. The multiverse is constantly trying to erase them. He can fix it, but the party must return the captured version of themselves to him. He will remember.
18. When the party is sent back in time, they replace themselves at the time, so there is no "2 versions of the same person" issues.
19. Party return to Shameshka, hopefully win, and hopefully Shameshka manages to escape.
20. Return bodies to Chronepsis, he forces the Modrons to forget about the party, ending the glitch, and then "writes them into the timeline" so that they truly now do exist. He warns that the Lady of Pain may not take kindly to their meddling in the multiverse.
21. The players fade to black, and the Lady of Pain appears before them, shakes her head, and they appear in the mazes. When they escape, they appear back before Chronepsis. He suspects that she was testing the party, rather than hindering them.
22. The players can now choose how their incarnates combine to create their final character. This is the new level jump to 17th level.
23. R04M asks them to free the Modron Legion, like in the book.
	1. Portal to Gzemnid's Realm could be in a location important to the players, such as in the Doomguard or Fated's headquarters. R04M holds the key
24. The players arrive to Tryant's Spiral to find the corpses of adventurers who bare the same Nexus Feature as they do.
25. Fight with X01 and the Planar Incarnate as normal, replacing memory with the Mimir recorded memories.
	1. Possibly a bunch of glitching incarnations of the party, based on how many times they died.
26. X01, after the fight, reveals that the march was called early by the primus in search of an artifact.
	1. Maybe this legion found it in Gzemnid's realm. Gzemnid had tried to steal it for himself.
27. The trapped legion in Pandemonium have it, and it is the Wand of Orcus
	1. Orcus killed Primus and took his place, so that he may get his wand back.
	2. It is up the PCs to decide how to deal with this
