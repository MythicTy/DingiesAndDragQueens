17 months, one for each outer plane, and one for the outlands itself, each 21 days.

The 16 outer plane months come in order, and represent each outer plane. The 17th month, the veiled month, comes in random. When it falls over the month related to Mechanus, that is when the great modron march occurs. This occurs consistently every 289 years, despite the randomness of the veiled month.

The most recent great modron march occurred during Ironskies, the month associated with Carceri, 189 years earlier than it should have. This occured in the year 28,711. It should have occurred in the year 28,900. You are now in the year 28,718, in the month of Revolvis, the month of Mechanus. There are some large groups of modrons returning to mechanus in various months, labelled as parts of the great modron march, but very clearly not all of them, suspiciously so.

This can be seen via the logbook, as a great surge of modrons left on the train in the year.

In the year 28,715, in the month of Revolvis, R04M left mechanus. There is no mention of him ever entering mechanus.

There are also a lot of mentions of Councellor Isthil consistently getting on the train with a Doomguard named Cornelus. They enter the train from Automata, and return within the same day.
