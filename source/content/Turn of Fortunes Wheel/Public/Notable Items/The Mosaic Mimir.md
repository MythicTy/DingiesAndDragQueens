The Mosaic Mimir is damaged, and holds information that is currently inaccessible, such as [[R04M]]'s whereabouts or info about his "friends" that he is trying to free. To repair it, you must travel to a number of gatetowns and their portals and fill in the information about the gatetowns and your experiences of them. Only then will it reveal it's secrets.
