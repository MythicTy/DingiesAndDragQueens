You encountered Felik in Sigil. He died years ago and was taken to Excelsior from the Fugue Plane to prove devotion to Bahamut. He returned to Sigil to find his father, [[Valder]], but hadn't yet found him. He was tracked by a Mercykiller, also looking for his father for a bounty. 

He thanked you for helping him, but couldn't offer any other information.
