You met Morte in [[The Mortuary]]. He's a debonair planes explorer and writer (somehow) of Morte's Planar Parade. He wasn't of much help, other than welcoming you to [[The Mortuary]] and warning you of the zombies that patrolled the halls. He also made you aware that you had awoken in Sigil, the Centre of the Multiverse.
