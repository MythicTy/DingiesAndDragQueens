The enigmatic ruler of Sigil. She bars gods and other god-like figures from entering her city, and hates worship. Anyone brave enough to attempt to worship her would be lucky if they were only flayed on the spot. Some get sent to the Mazes, a dark and endless labyrinth of city streets that are stalked by something. There are rumours of an escape portal at the centre, but people who claim to have escaped are often brushed off as liars. 

You encountered the Lady of Pain as you approached the Rearing Horse Statue to leave Sigil.

> Approaching the rearing horse statue, you feel a weight, a pressure that seems to still the air. There is no sound, like the whole of Sigil is holding its breath. People have stopped in their tracks, awestruck or in fear, you can't tell. But you clearly see the object of their attention.

> Floating from around the corner, surrounded by a cadre of dabus, is a singular figure. She is wrapped in flowing robes of red and gold with a metal bodice covered in verdigris that goes up to an expressionless mask wreathed with blades. Her attention turns towards you, and you can feel her overwhelming presence.

> The moment is an eternity, but it ends wordlessly as the Lady of Pain turns and floats toward the Lower Wards.
