> Sunflies are the natural indicator species of the Outlands. What this means is that the health of the Sunflies, and the health of their populations, are a direct reflection of the health of the Outlands and the various ecosystems within it. When Sunflies prosper, so does the Outlands. When Sunflies struggle, then so does the Outlands.
