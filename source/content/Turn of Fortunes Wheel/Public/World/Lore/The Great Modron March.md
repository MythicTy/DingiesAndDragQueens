The Great Modron March is a large concession of modrons that leave Mechanus to survey [[The Outlands]] and report back to the primus in Mechanus. It sets off every 289 years, when The Veiled falls over Revolvis ([see the calendar for more](https://rilmani.org/timaresh/Outlands_calendar)). Despite the consistency of the march's timekeeping, the most recent one left 189 years early during Ironskies, causing all sorts of issues. The march took an unusual path which was difficult to track, and the march split off multiple times into smaller groups. There were more casualties and losses than usual, [[Clocksworth]] being one of them.
