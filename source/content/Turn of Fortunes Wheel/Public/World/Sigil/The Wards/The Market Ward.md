# Institute of Intellectual Excellence
You travelled here to meet [[Enoll Eva]], the academy's dean. You entered during a lecture of her's on How Belief May Shape The Planes.

> Many great philosophers of the city have pondered the relationship between worshippers and their gods. The Athar believe that the Gods are merely powerful mortals, yet curiously Gods grow and fade, as do their clergy. Aoskar is thought to be no more.

> Just as belief in the Hands of Havok grows their ideals, can such not be the case with the Gods? Maybe Aoskar died because people believed he had died. Therefore, can the same not be case with our reality? If enough believe in something, that thing may manifest.

> For your next assignment, you will go away and research this theory. Perhaps you may discuss what the many factions have to say on this matter. Your deadline is in 37 days and 87 minutes. Dismissed.

She had no clue why you were all glitching and has never seen anything related. She could only surmise that it may be tied to the energy of the planes or some time travel related things.

She also commented that weird things have been happening recently, such as the [[The Great Modron March]] leaving 189 years ahead of schedule, a strange occurrence for beings of absolute law.
# The Great Bazaar
> The streets of the Market Ward open up into a vast, bustling plaza of chromatic tents and stalls, intertwined between permanent establishments. The sounds of sizzling foods, clanking of weaponry, and mingling of people fill your ears. Boisterous throngs of shoppers crowd the bustling avenues, doing business with vendors hailing from all corners of the multiverse. You make eye contact with a little girl, who boisterously waves and smiles at you, and then runs along.

> Scents collide in the winding stalls: warm, right angled bread loaves prepared fresh by modron bakers; spotted mushrooms hocked by bullywug grocers; and perfumed holy water sold by winged Celestials. Vibrant produce dangles from the leafy awnings of living plant stalls, and masterwork armours forged from rare metals bear insignias from blacksmiths on other worlds

> The cosmopolitan sampling of the planes and all they have to offer stands before you.

Many interesting events happening here. You started your stop with some shopping. Bawk purchased a Bag of Withholding here, alongside a Mimic Ring.

## A Major Issue
> The crowd of people within the massive market square you find yourselves in parts like a wave as a group of lightly armored individuals march into the center of the area. The group consists of all manner of humanoids; hobgoblins and humans, dwarves and ogres. Each of them have shimmering rank insignias pinned to their chests. The command to halt is given and the member of their group leading them steps out to the side and stands before them, a hobgoblin female with her legs akimbo and hands clasped at her back. "For some of you, this is your first shore leave. I don't have to remind you, this is a privilege. We'll be returning to Rigus in 24 hours. Should you fail to return at the appointed time, you and your battle buddy will be court-martialed. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?"

> The group responds back as one forceful bark, "Ma'am, yes ma'am!"

> The leader dismisses the group and they disperse.

> The hobgoblin goes about her shopping, a sly smile of excitement on her face as she peruses the weapons on display in a nearby stall.

You met [[Major Nirra Kalar]] here. She was bringing her troop on shore leave from Rigus to shop for equipment. She recognised [[Uthal]] as he, alongside [[Grim and Flint]], attempted to extort money from her soldiers.

> The hobgoblin woman turns and does a double-take at your party and immediately starts to stride toward you, locking eyes with Uthal. "My, my. If it isn't the runt who tried to threaten my men for tax. You're lucky its busy here, because, if I remember correctly, I said I'd put my sword through your chest if I ever saw you again. Surprised you're not with your two little buddies." She puts her hand firmly and tensely on the top of your sword at her waist. "Still tempted to run you through right now, why shouldn't I?"

After talking his way out of it, she handed him a grey badge and encouraged him to stop by Rigus if he ever found himself round that way, she might have some work for him.

> "Usually I wouldn't offer the following to someone I threatened to kill, but I actually kind of like you and your gang's gall. If you find yourself needing work and are nearby Rigus, use this to get in and say you're there to talk to me. They'll let you in with no hassle... mostly". She hands you a small, grey badge with a red ribbon attached to the bottom. The badge is engraved with a sword and an axe crossing over each other.
# Felicity's Threads
Walking through the streets of the Market Ward, [[Bawk]] recognised a shop named Felicity's Thread. He went inside, being greeted by name by [[Felicity]], the owner of the store. Felicity was a Darkweaver, a giant shadow spider. 

> You don’t remember? It’s unlike you not to remember things. You got me information on some competition's fabric shipments after I sent a Squeak to contact you, and I had them catch fire. Paid off a rogue hand of havoc to do it for me. Business is tough here in the Cage, gotta take any opportunity you can get. And you know me, I like to keep up with the web of information you weave. If you hear anything else, send me a Squeak will ya?”

> “Because we’re good business partners, I’ll give you a discount on my services.”
