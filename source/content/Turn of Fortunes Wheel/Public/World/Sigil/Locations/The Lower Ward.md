# The Armoury
> Razorvine creeps along bladed balconies and sharp lower walls, and heavy metal gates bar the building's few windows. A menacing horned skull - the faction's symbol - hangs over the main entrance. Above the building towers tall chimneys belching thick, black smoke and flame, causing a smog to envelop the surrounding area.

> A colossal forge dominates the floor as you enter. Mercenaries, mongers, and other curious buyers gawk at the industrious smithies accustomed the the forge's unbearable temperatures. Azers, fire elementals, and chain devils number among the Armory's blacksmiths, alongside dwarves and other smiths.

You entered here in search of answers due to Kazaan being a previous member of the Doomguard. [[Aslan Ashfang]], welcomed you.

After a short while, you noticed movement of guards above you. Out of one of the upper balcony doors walked [[Doomlord Abraxis]], who confronted [[Kazaan]] about still being alive. A fight ensued, killing Uthal and Kazaan. Bawk and Thistle fled, but not before Bawk made a deal with [[Aslan Ashfang]], requiring him to kill Sabril Kahaar, a rival merchant in Tradegate.
