>  The flavours of the multiverse converge at the Grease Pit, a noisy alley brimming with planar street food. Creatures come from far and wide to sample its delights or hawk them to hungry customers over the hubbub of the daily crowds.

> All manner of scents caress your nostrils. You can hear the sizzling of meat skewers from a nearby stall, boasting about how its oil is taken straight from the battlefields of Acheron. A nearby fiend roasts mystery meat above a blazing fire. A mind flayer salts massive abyssal chicken kebabs before passing them to a salivating ogre.
