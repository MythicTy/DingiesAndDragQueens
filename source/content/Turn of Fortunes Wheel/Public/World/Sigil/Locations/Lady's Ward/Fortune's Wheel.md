> You stand before the giant marquee of a casino that read "Fortune's Wheel" in a dazzling font. Fashionably dressed locals laugh, arm in arm, as they push through the casino's polished gold revolving door to the gambling hall within.

> Farrow lets out a satisfied sight. "This is the place."

Farrow guided you here through [[Undersigil]] to meet his employer, and proprietor of the establishment, [[Shemeshka]]. You were welcomed by a snappily dressed tiefling bellhop named Valek, who handed you a letter.

> "Welcome to the Dragon's Bar! I am Valek and I will be your bellhop for the duration of your stay here. I have a letter for your group from the proprietor of this fine establishment."

You were invited to your rooms, small demi-planes in the upper levels that were decorated divinely, with silk and satin everything. You rested, got dressed, and headed down to the casino proper to enjoy your time there.

> Heavy doors swing inward, revealing a jingling fountain of gold coins rising from the floor of an extravagant gambling hall. The glittering spout originates from the open palm of a statue depicting a confident arcanaloth cast in solid gold. The fountain's inscription reads, "Fortune Favors the Bold."

> Hundreds of people from across the planes congregate around all manner of games, refreshments, and performances in this lavish, magical casino. 

# The Casino
Bawk made some counterfeit tokens to spend in the casino. Despite this, you all net lost money. Lady luck did not look kindly upon you this day. 

## Notable Encounters
### Winter's Bite
You met a young white dragon at the bar named [[Winter's Bite]]. He was down on his luck and lost all of his horde to the machines. Later on in the evening, he went on a rampage, getting up on stage and scaring the performers off. Somehow, this turned into a metal concert with Bawk and Thistle. You dealt with the situation, sending Winter's Bite off on his path to stardom. 

### Vecna Impersonators
3 doppelgangers dressed as bad impersonators of Vecna entered the casino, harassing Uthal who didn't notice them pickpocketing him. Everyone was none the wiser.

### Shemeshka Arrives
The owner of Fortune's Wheel, [[Shemeshka]], arrived to cheers and applause in a fancy golden staircase that descended from the ceiling. You went to a private side room with her to discuss her proposal. She checked that you had enjoyed her casino and inquired about your current predicament. You explained your situation, and she offered a solution.

> - "I propose a deal. There is a certain slippery monodrone that has vanished into the outlands that I need you to track down. His name is [[R04M]], and he's a rogue accountant and I'm just too busy with this casino to do it myself, and I'm... rather short staffed at the moment. A loose end that I need dealt with. Whilst you do that, I will dig up information on your pasts through my many contacts. Are you interested?"

She reassured you all after you questioned her intentions. 

> - "My intentions are none of your concern, but I commend the caution; it's rarely wise to trust a fiend. But I assure you, my line of work thrives off of mutual distrust. What difference does it make if both parties get what they want? To sweeten the deal, I'll offer you 300 gold pieces each, upfront."

She was also aware that you were barred from a few locations, and promised that her agents would gather information from your pasts whilst you searched for her rogue accountant, [[R04M]]. She passed you a piece of lapis lazuli shaped like an eye, explaining it to be a portal key that leads to [[The Outlands]], near [[Automata]]. The portal was a rearing horse statue located in the Lady's Ward. She then excused herself to go and set off her agents to dig up information for you, and warned you not to gamble all of the 300gp away.

Throughout this entire conversation, she appeared composed and cordial, confident and sophisticated, and didn't appear pretentious or insincere. She seemed to really care to help you all out.
