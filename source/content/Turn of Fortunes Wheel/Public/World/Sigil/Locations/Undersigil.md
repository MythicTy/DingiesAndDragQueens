# Stuffed Rat
> A tunnel leads through a half-collapsed basement. At the centre of the chamber, a rat with an exposed brain and a bloated stomach lies belly0ip on a porcelain plate scattered ith pink crumbs. As the rodent meets your gace, you hear a low voice in your mind. "Do what you must," it says. "We have already won."

Uthal promptly squished it, triggered a swarm of cranium rats to swarm the party and Farrow.
# Twisted Tea Party
You fought the [[Coterie of Cakes]], a forgotten faction. They were gorging themselves on fiendish cakes that turned them in Vargouilles, and invited you all to join them. After refusing to sit down, they attacked. 

You found a Portal Compass here.![[02-12 Caker Tea Party.png]]![[02-12 Vargouille Reflection.png]]
# Kazaan's Advisor
You met [[Sirus, Kazaan's Advisor]], here.
# Sire Oliver and the Rats
You encounted [[Sire Oliver]] the Twisted here for the second time. He was doing something with the cranium rats that infested Undersigil; what that was, you're unsure. He escaped again.
