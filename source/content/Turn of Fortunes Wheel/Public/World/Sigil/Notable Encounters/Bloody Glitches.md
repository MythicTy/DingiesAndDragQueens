> As you wander the vast streets of the City of Doors, you happen across a demon and a devil locked in brutal, bloody combat in the middle of a crossroads. The devil, equipped in rusty plate and seeping with black blood swings a massive great axe at a formerly four armed demon, now sporting only three, who ducks out the way, swiped at the devil's belly, drawing more viscous black blood. The great axe cracks against the cobbles, leaving a crater from the impact.

> No one around seems to take notice, just idly waltzing by, going about their daily business.
