# Encountering Iedcaru
Following the impact marks in the ground just after you arrived, you happened across an ornate tower.

> Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six opening lead into the structure.

The castle had been overtaken by fiends that you later learned were bounty hunters looking for the same R04M as you were. You cleared them out along with their leader, [[Thlaarsh the Gore Drinker]].
