# Encountering Iedcaru
Following the impact marks in the ground just after you arrived, you happened across an ornate tower.

> Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six opening lead into the structure.

The castle had been overtaken by fiends that you later learned were bounty hunters looking for the same R04M as you were. You cleared them out along with their leader, [[Thlaarsh the Gore Drinker]], who managed to get the drop on your party, spearing Thistle with his claws from behind. 

You rescued [[Zaythir]], the keeper of Iedcaru, from her imprisonment. She explained that the fiends had followed R04M to the castle, but he escaped. Because of that, they decided to stay and try to figure out how to hijack the structure for their own purposes. She was in your debt, and allowed you to use the castle as your base in your travels whilst you looked for R04M, in exchange for giving him a chance because he seemed like a nice enough person. 
# The History of Iedcaru
The castle is a repository of study and learning, built by the Githzerai long ago. They built it so that they could travel and study [[The Outlands]], logging their findings in the vast library found on the bottom floor. [[Zaythir]] is the current of a long line of keepers of Iedcaru. In a sarcophagus located on the ground floor is the mummified remains of [[Laxuelu]], the first keeper of the castle. 
# The Castle Layout
The castle has 5 floors, and is capable of moving at a fixed 17mph. The castle will only move when the Castellan tells it to.

## First Floor - Library
This floor is the castle library, containing vast amounts of books and writings on esoteric philosophies, multiversal theories, and studies of the various planes and gatetowns. It also contains the mummified remains of [[Laxuelu]], the first keeper and caretaker of the castle. Speaking a desire for a text on a certain topic, it's eyes of brass flick to look at the exact location of the book in the library. 

> All manner of tomes, scrolls, tablets, and folios cram the towering shelves of this airy library. An ancient wooden table surrounded by matching benches stands at the room’s center, near an ornate spiral staircase that climbs through the ceiling above. To the north are statues of githzerai scholars and an alcove with a table covered in candles. To the south, in an- other alcove, stands a crystal sarcophagus.
## Second Floor - Living Quarters
This floor contains Zaythir's study, alongside various rooms and a bathroom. The bathroom's taps feature a small portal to the Elemental Plane of Water, providing infinite, clean water. One bedroom has a nest in it, now claimed by Bawk and Thistle.

> A spiral staircase emerges through the ﬂoor into this multiuse kitchen and social area. To the ?Ff der ascends to the floor above, and six simple doors ring the room. To the west are several cabinets and cooking spaces.
### Zaythir's Study
> A sizable desk stands opposite the door in this stuffy study. Cabinets, crowded bookshelves, and maps of the Outer Planes cover the room’s walls. In the south corner stands a simple cot. 
## Third Floor - The Castellan
> This chamber is dominated by a sculpture of a gigantic, humanlike figure looming over a broad, circular table. A ladder to the north descends, while a ladder to the south climbs to the floor above. 

This room is the home of the Castellan who commands the castle. So far, you know that it only understand Gith, and only respects Zaythir. It shows a map of [[The Outlands]] or the castle and it's damages.

## Fourth Floor - Meditation Chamber
> Ancient Tapestries of the planes and cosmic alignments cover the walls of this simple room. Ladders descend to the floor below and rise to the level above.

This is a simple room dedicated to meditation.
## Fifth Floor - Signal Tower
> Narrow windows look out from this stark stone cham- ber in every direction. In the room’s center stands a green crystal atop a stone pillar. A ladder descends to the floor below.

In the centre of this room is a Gem of Brightness affixed to the tower. This can be used to signal creatures over a mile away.
