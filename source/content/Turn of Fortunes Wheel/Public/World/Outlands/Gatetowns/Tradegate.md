> The gatetown to Bytopia brings a slice of Sigil's Market Ward, without the cutthroat competition of capitalism, or the shady back markets of the Hive Ward. Tradegate is a town of industrious labourers and gentle traders, buzzy plazas and quaint boutiques, and quiet crafts and wild inventions.

> The steady flow of people entering the gatetown splits off in two. One group head straight towards the markets, and another towards a large stone stronghold with cobalt decorations to the building. A large sign sits at the top of this structure; "Trademill Mint. Can't shop without Lodestars!"
