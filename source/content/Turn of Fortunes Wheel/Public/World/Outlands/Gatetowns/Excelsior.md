> Floating gardens and palaces orbit the towering structures of Excelsior. From amid the tallest buildings rises a tower of alabaster and gleaming, coloured glass that reaches into the clouds. As you near the tower, your mimir rings like a bell, and its eyes pulse with golden light.

> The streets of Excelsior are flecked with gold and silver that sparkle in the radiant glow of the gatetown. Busy celestials and humans go about their business. Even the occasional fiend, possibly converted in their faith, mill about. Towers climb ever upward into the billowing clouds, atop many are floating citadels. Glistening streams of holy water cascade down from many of the floating citadels pooling in fountains at ground level.

> This divine citadel makes every other location you have visited appear bleak and dull in comparison. You feel calm here, in no small part because of the fragrant perfumes that ride on the winds, or the melodic tunes that radiant from buskers and performers around each street corner.

> Uthal specifically finds the light weirdly repulsive. Your perception is different, its tacky, garish, and vile. It makes you ill just looking at it, almost supernaturally so.

You were greeted by a lantern archon named Blibly who welcomed you to Excelsior. You also acquired a Polymorph T Shirt here.

> "Welcome to Excelsior! I'm Blibly! Where are you looking to go today?"

> "The portal to Mount Celestia is atop the Godstrand. The climb is about 18 minutes. Can I offer you some water for the journey? Hot day today."
# The Godstrand
The portal to Mount Celestia is atop the Godstrand, an 18 minute climb up the staircase. The walls of the Godstrand are adorned with various mosaics and depictions of various gods. [[Uthal]] saw differently, however. 
## Uthal's Haunting
He saw flashbacks in the mosaic of atrocities he had committed in life. 

It started by showing a mother who he evicted from a property after failing to pay their mortgage. The vision continued to show her and her children on the streets of [[The Hive Ward]], begging. 

The next forced him to feel the shame and guilt, the cowardice, of when he abandoned his family and friends to die in the reckless charge he led in [[Glorium]].

He saw glimpses of the various people he, [[Grim and Flint|Grim]], and [[Grim and Flint|Flint]] intimidated out of the money they owed. Often times inflated above what they actually owed so that they could get a better cut. 

He saw a memory of a bloody pulp he remembered to be a man, cowering family in the back of the room. All for the crime of missing rent.

The visions ended in the worst of the bunch. A child, attempting to protect their parent, being pushed over, blood pooling around their head. 

These visions left [[Uthal]] exhausted, unable to continue moving up the Godstrand. He was found by a Wardon Archon, broken down on the stairs. He was removed from the tower and given first aid.
## Atop The Godstrand
Bawk and Thistle left the rest of the party behind and ascended the tower. 

> A fragrant breeze wafts across the platform atop the Godstrand. Several benches and bare pedestals surround a final flight of seven golden stairs. Atop these stairs, an archway of endlessly interweaving golden trans forms the gate to Mount Celestia. Two towering, bear-headed sentinels in heavy armour guard the gate. Other locals linger nearby, meditating on the gate.

You filled in the Mimir here. You also met a warden archon names [[Varrel]] here. 

> The canine-headed archon lowers his voice and says, “I'm in an unusual predicament. Locals have been disappearing from Excelsior for weeks. My investigations led me to a tiefling named Sincerity, who has been seen near many of the places where people went missing. Recently I saw her enter a garden, and an individual there vanished soon after. Sincerity is being questioned at our headquarters now, but unless the interviewers turn up something, we have no proof to hold her. I have my suspicions, but I won’t accuse someone who could be innocent based on my own possibly flawed perspective. 

> “That’s where you come in. You're not from Excelsior. I'd love to get visitors’ insights on the situation and see if they reveal anything new. What do you say?”
## The Disappearances
| Name     | Type       | Last Seen                   |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Adorae   | Dragonborn | Her home                    |
| Changle  | Gnome      | An alley near the godstrand |
| Irruwabi | Human      | The Temple of the Sunweaver |
| Wobeke   | Human      | His home                    |
| Yoi      | Tielfing   | The Forum                   |
Multiple residents had been going missing recently. [[Varrel]] suspected that it was [[Sincerity]], a tiefling woman. [[Varrel]] returned you to the Town Guard Headquarters and briefed you on situation. [[Thistle]] excused himself to the bathroom, making horrid grinding noises and eventually exploding the toilet. 

Over your course of investigations, you discovered that [[Sincerity]] had a collection of [[The Outlands|Sunflies]]. She would capture her victims in magic jars and her [[The Outlands|Sunflies]] would fly them to a wagon outside of Excelsior. This wagon was owned by [[Uncle Longteeth]], a hag who was sending their victims to another hag in [[The Outlands]] to turn them into Soul Larva (the entry is on [[The Outlands]] entry). You also discovered that Uncle Longteeth and Sincerity were under the effect of the Glibness spell. You killed Uncle Longteeth and returned the jars to Excelsior, where they released the lost people.
