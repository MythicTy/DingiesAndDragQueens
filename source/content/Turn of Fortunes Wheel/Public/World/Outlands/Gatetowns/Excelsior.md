> Floating gardens and palaces orbit the towering structures of Excelsior. From amid the tallest buildings rises a tower of alabaster and gleaming, coloured glass that reaches into the clouds. As you near the tower, your mimir rings like a bell, and its eyes pulse with golden light.

> The streets of Excelsior are flecked with gold and silver that sparkle in the radiant glow of the gatetown. Busy celestials and humans go about their business. Even the occasional fiend, possibly converted in their faith, mill about. Towers climb ever upward into the billowing clouds, atop many are floating citadels. Glistening streams of holy water cascade down from many of the floating citadels pooling in fountains at ground level.

> This divine citadel makes every other location you have visited appear bleak and dull in comparison. You feel calm here, in no small part because of the fragrant perfumes that ride on the winds, or the melodic tunes that radiant from buskers and performers around each street corner.

> Uthal specifically finds the light weirdly repulsive. Your perception is different, its tacky, garish, and vile. It makes you ill just looking at it, almost supernaturally so.
# The Godstrand
The portal to Mount Celestia is atop the Godstrand, an 18 minute climb up the staircase. The walls of the Godstrand are adorned with various mosaics and depictions of various gods. [[Uthal]] saw differently, however.
