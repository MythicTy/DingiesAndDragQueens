# Entering the Outlands
You entered the Outlands using a portal in a three-eye rearing horse statue. The portal was nearby to [[Automata]].

> You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognizable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archy, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads towards a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces.

> Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.

Following the impact divots, you found [[The Walking Castle]].

# Beliefs in the Outlands
It is theorised that the Outlands is shaped by belief. If enough people believe it to be so, it might become so. However, this is near impossible to prove, as being aware of the fact you believe something makes it so that you don't truly believe it. Maybe the Outlands is shaped by belief because enough people believe it is?
