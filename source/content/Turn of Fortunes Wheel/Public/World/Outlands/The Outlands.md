# Entering the Outlands
You entered the Outlands using a portal in a three-eye rearing horse statue. The portal was nearby to [[Automata]].

> You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognizable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archy, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads towards a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces.

> Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.

Following the impact divots, you found [[The Walking Castle]].

# Beliefs in the Outlands
It is theorised that the Outlands is shaped by belief. If enough people believe it to be so, it might become so. However, this is near impossible to prove, as being aware of the fact you believe something makes it so that you don't truly believe it. Maybe the Outlands is shaped by belief because enough people believe it is? 
# The Hag's Lair
On your travels you met a lone knight and his horse. He was travelling to kill a night hag who had stolen children from his town. You helped him, offering him a ride on the Walking Castle. You discovered that the hag had corrupted the surrounding area and mind controlled a number of creatures. A pack of wolves were the first you encountered, their leader with a crown of thorns on it's head. You removed the crown, freeing it. You encountered the same with a dryad. Once you freed the dryad, she helped you kill a bunch blights that had surprised you.

You entered the lair to discover an annis hag also under the control of the night hag. You did the same and freed her, moving on to the night hag.

You dealt with the night hag and then the annis hag, discovering that the night hag was using a Dagger of Soul Cleaving to turn people in soul larva to be sold. You freed the remaining children, along with a werewolf who had been permanently changed.

You also discovered a letter.

> Dear Mistress Margrice,

> I thank you for your service in harvesting the souls from the iron flasks I sent you, saves me a trip to Hades. I hope you kept a couple for yourself as payment.

> You can expect another batch of flasks soon, just waiting on my agent's deliveries to my cabin.

> Say hello to Gertha for me as well.

> Best wishes, Uncle Longteeth.

You later discovered that this letter was from [[Uncle Longteeth]] nearby to [[Excelsior]]. This hag was turning people into soul larva for [[Uncle Longteeth]]. You identified the night hag as [[Mistress Margrice]].
# Sunflies
> Sunflies are the natural indicator species of the Outlands. What this means is that the health of the Sunflies, and the health of their populations, are a direct reflection of the health of the Outlands and the various ecosystems within it. When Sunflies prosper, so does the Outlands. When Sunflies struggle, then so does the Outlands.

Sunflies are particularly susceptible to planar energies. Sunflies that hang out near the lower planes sting with fire-y energy, whereas upper planar sunflies may blind your or make you shed bright light. Their colours tend to resemble the energies that they are filled with, but some may differ.
