You encountered Abraxis in [[The Lower Ward|The Armoury]] in Sigil. He confronted [[DnD/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Kazaan]] about surviving an assassination attempt.

Abraxis is the current Doomlord of [[Muspelforge]], successor to Kazaan.

> - "Didn't expect to see you back here, though I assumed you survived after the mess you made of our assassins. I commend the bravery, though."

It's unknown why he attempted to kill Kazaan, but talked of "philosophical differences" and "getting in the way of our plans". He also mentioned killing Kazaan's advisors. After noticing that Kazaan didn't remember, he refused to elaborate as there was no need.

He killed Kazaan and Uthal after toying with you all. Thistle and Bawk fled.
