Thaez was a tabaxi bard turned demilich that worked for the [[Heralds of Dust]] as an eulogist. You encountered him in [[The Hive Ward|The Mortuary]] where he was toiling over writing a eulogy for a deceased person. From one artist to another, [[Bawk]] helped him write it, and in return he showed you to your party’s death certificates; you’re cause of death was notably absent.
