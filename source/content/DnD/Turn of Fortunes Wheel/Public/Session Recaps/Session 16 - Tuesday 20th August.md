It was a short session due to the badly timed DnD Beyond maintenance.

You started the session trapped in a room surrounded by the 4 guards alerted by Thistle. They threw a tear gas grenade into the room, forcing you out. You killed them, though notably the guard who Thistle alerted originally wasn't present. This racked your kill count up to 10.

You scouted more of the house, will Bawk taking notice of the statue in the lobby. It was lighter than you'd expect, and when you switched it for the golden statue you found, it opened up a portal that led to a staircase down to a long marble hallway. At the end of the hallway was a vault.

The hallway was riddled with traps, such as tiles that launch fireballs, lasers that fire scorching rays at whoever triggers them, a circle of runes before the vault door. Bawk and Kazaan managed to get past the circle, which triggers a pinkish pulse and a mist to form when triggered, but the effects are still unknown.

The vault door is locked, with no discernible keyhole, but does have a large metal wheel on the front, like your stereotypical vault door.
