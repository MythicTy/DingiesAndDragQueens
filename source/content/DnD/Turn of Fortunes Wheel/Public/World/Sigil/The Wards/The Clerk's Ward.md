The home of the [[Fated]]. The building was originally a college that was foreclosed after a slightly overdue debt. Originally seven towers, the library was sold and walled off.

You entered, and browsed the records in search of answers. You researched each of the party, alongside [[Grim and Flint]]. [[DnD/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Uthal]] stole the documents on Grim and Flint. After a while, the party were escorted out by giants. It was not explained why.
