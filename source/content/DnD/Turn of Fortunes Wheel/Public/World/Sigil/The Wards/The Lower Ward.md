# The Armoury
> Razorvine creeps along bladed balconies and sharp lower walls, and heavy metal gates bar the building's few windows. A menacing horned skull - the faction's symbol - hangs over the main entrance. Above the building towers tall chimneys belching thick, black smoke and flame, causing a smog to envelop the surrounding area.

> A colossal forge dominates the floor as you enter. Mercenaries, mongers, and other curious buyers gawk at the industrious smithies accustomed the the forge's unbearable temperatures. Azers, fire elementals, and chain devils number among the Armory's blacksmiths, alongside dwarves and other smiths.

You entered here in search of answers due to Kazaan being a previous member of the Doomguard. [[Aslan Ashfang]], welcomed you.

After a short while, you noticed movement of guards above you. Out of one of the upper balcony doors walked [[Doomlord Abraxis]], who confronted [[DnD/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Characters/Player Characters/Kazaan]] about still being alive. A fight ensued, killing Uthal and Kazaan. Bawk and Thistle fled, but not before Bawk made a deal with [[Aslan Ashfang]], requiring him to kill Sabril Kahaar, a rival merchant in Tradegate.
# The Ubiquitous Wayfairer
The Ubiquitous Wayfairer is a tavern and inn accessible from hundreds of portals across Sigil, and was the main place you stayed during your time in Sigil.

When you first arrived, the place was on fire. This was merely a glitch that only you could see. [[Parisa]] didn't see it, who was with you at the time.

You were greeted by [[Riaen Blackhome]], the owner of the inn. She welcomed you back and asked if you all wanted the same room as before, but apologised because it hadn't been cleaned since you last used it. Despite investigating the room, you found nothing of note.

The morning after your escapade at [[The Lower Ward|The Armoury]], a hooded figure with distinctive tattoo arrived to meet you all, warning you that the [[Harmonium]] were hunting you all and that his employer had a proposition. He'd take you safely to see them. He was [[Farrow]].
