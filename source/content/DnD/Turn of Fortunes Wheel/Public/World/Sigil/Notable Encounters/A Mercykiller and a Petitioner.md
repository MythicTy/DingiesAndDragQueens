> This ward is full of expensive homes with breathtaking vistas and solemn streets where few people travel by foot. Several megastructures are situated in the heart of the ward, a grey slate tree-like building being the tallest of them.

> As you continue to walk deeper into the ward, the quiet at the street level is broken by the screeching sound of blades on stone. "Where is he, Fellik?", an angry voice demands. You turn toward the source and can see a humanoid in black armor and a dark hood threatening what looks like a blue, transparent ghost of a young man in a belted tunic who holds his hand up in front of his face. "I..I..don't know!"

This encounter was between [[Felik]], a petitioner looking for his father, [[Valder]], and a Mercykiller who was also looking for Valder.

You all swooped in, beat up the Mercykiller with Hold Person, and sent them limping away, warning that you'd made a powerful enemy.
