The crux of the campaign, and the thing you are adventuring to discover the origins of. The Glitch makes it so that when you die, your corpse disappears, and nearby appears an alternate variant of yours. Your memories do not carry over through this process, and each variant remembers up until it's death.

You fail to remember much up until you awoke in [[The Hive Ward|The Mortuary]], your memories fragmented and lost. Alongside these memory losses are strange dreams. Each night, you dream of being trapped in a crystal. On a few occasions, you have gained lucidity. You can read more about these in the [[DnD/Turn of Fortunes Wheel/Public/Dream Sequences/index|Dream Sequences]] entries.

Your party are not the only ones who suffers from the Glitch. [[Grim and Flint]] do, but seem not to suffer from the same amnesia that you do. Various other objects and locations also seem to Glitch, and the landscape of [[The Outlands]] seems to regularly Glitch to appear like [[The Blood War]].

Recently, the Glitch has been worsening. [[The Outlands]] experienced earthquakes that caused you to be racked by the unimaginable pain of all your death wounds from your different variants. [[Bawk]] felt it the worst, due to his (at the time) 32 deaths. From this point, your deaths have been more exhausting than usual. 

There is also a theme of the Glitch leaving dead [[The Outlands|sunflies]] in its wake. The two times you have experienced these earthquakes has left fields of the insects dead.

> At that same time, you feel... a shaking. Like the tremors of an earthquake.

> The earthquake worsens, but so does your aches and pain.

> Your look at your hands, racked by unimaginable pain. You look almost as if you're chromatically aberrating, your hands phase to the sides in blue and red. You are forced to your knees from the pain. You manage to force your head to look up at your companions. They phase between their different variants, the other ones phasing in red and blue to their sides. Another wave of pain racks you all as the earth shakes again.

> Your vision goes blurry as you begin to see multiple of everything. But these are not mere chromatic aberrations. The fog is mysteriously clear now, and the landscape of the outlands itself glitches between the normal vibrant landscape and an orange hued, scorched wasteland. There's another cascade of pain and a stronger earthquake.

> The pain subsides a bit. You catch your breath. You're unsure of what just happened, apart from one thing. The Glitch is worse that it was before.

> Looking around at the scenery outside the Walking Castle, you no longer see a hellish version of the Outlands, but the field surrounding the castle is littered with hundreds of dead Sunflies in every direction surrounding you.
