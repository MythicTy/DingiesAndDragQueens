> Once again, you find yourself in the familiar crystal, but this time with lucidity. Contrary to the norm, you see numerous floating crystals around this one in place of the usual emptiness.

> You walk on what feels like a solid crystal floor, but looking down there's no solid surface, just infinite expanse of whirling colours and various other crystals. The first crystal you come to is foggy, but you make out the feint picture of a red scaled dragonborn in well kept robes.

> The next crystal you come to is large, containing what looks like a pit fiend.

> The following crystals are filled with all sorts of creatures, from mind flayers to small gnomes to large aboleths. There are all manners of people and creatures trapped in these crystals. You do, however, come across one crystal containing a half elf armoured in rusty equipment. They're asleep, but lay there with a red bladed sword inside their crystal.

> You feel a tug on your shoulder, which turns into a rough pull as you're quickly yanked away from the crystal. You start awake.
