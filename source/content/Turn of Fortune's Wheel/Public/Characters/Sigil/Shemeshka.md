The owner of [[Fortune's Wheel]], Shemeshka is a rich and influential arcanaloth in Sigil. She has many agents throughout the city, in various factions, and it is well known that she has many strings to pull throughout the city. The [[Harmonium]] have no power over her establishments, and arrests are rarely a concern for her agents. 

She has contacted you since you previously met her in Sigil, writing to update you about her progress in discovering your backstories.

> “To the recipients of this letter,
> 
> I am unsure of how to refer to your group, as you never gave me a name, so apologies for no formal address. I do hope you write back with a better way to address you all.
> 
> On to important matters, I have got my agents hard at work trying to discover information about your pasts. So far they have not uncovered anything substantial, apart from things you would already have discovered for yourselves. I’m sure it comes as no surprise to discover that one among you were a prior member of the Doomguard, and another a member of the Fated. To the ‘prior’ part, my agents have yet to uncover why you are no longer a member, it would seem that the individual groups wish for this to not be known. My reach may be wide but not infinite.
> 
> I hope your search for my accountant goes well, though I expect that they are evading you as of now, they are quite slippery. And beware their silver tongue, they wouldn’t have gotten into their position in my organisation without it.
> 
> I’m sure that this adventure of yours will no doubt uncover more information about your pasts. The more I have learnt about you all, the more eager I am to know your full stories, so I look forward to learning about what you have discovered. Faction politics is so interesting, and the chance to learn about a Warforged is exciting.
> 
> If you wish to write back, stamp a letter with my seal and throw it, it will get to my desk eventually.
> 
> May Lady Luck shine favourably, ~S”
> 
> Below the sign off is a signature that resembles a razorvine.

She left you with a package with the materials to write back to her.
