Nirra is a hobgoblin woman, bound by duty and holding herself to high esteem. She hails from [[Rigus]], the gatetown to Acheron. You met her in [[The Great Bazaar]], in [[A Major Issue]].

She stood up to [[Uthal]], who she clearly had history with, and accosted him for attempting to tax her men at some point previous.

You do not know much more about her.
