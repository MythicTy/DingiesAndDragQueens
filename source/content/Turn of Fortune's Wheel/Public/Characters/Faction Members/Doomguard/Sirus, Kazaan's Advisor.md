You met Sirus in [[Undersigil]]. He had escaped the assassins sent to kill Kazaan, and was an advisor to him. He was clothed in a rugged cloak and had wiry white hair and a distinctive burn scar on his lower jaw.

He had raised a suspicious increase in weapon production to Kazaan, who went to ask questions and research. Next thing Sirus knew, guards are marching into the citadel and ransacking the place. Sirus assumed Kazaan was dead, and doesn't know what he found.

Sirus went into hiding in [[Undersigil]], unsure of what to do next. He posited leaving for Rigus to offer his blacksmithing skills to the ongoing happening in the gatetown. He encouraged the party to come see him if they ever found themselves out that way.

He did know that [[Muspelforge]] has been converted into a generic weaponry factory to mass produce armaments, rather than the high quality, bespoke equipment it used to produce for clients.

Finally he gifted Kazaan a Devotee's Censer, +1 - a weapon that Sirus had taken from Kazaan's armoury to defend himself as he fled. Kazaan would have better use of it.
