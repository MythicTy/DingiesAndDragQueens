You encountered Jex in [[The Mortuary]] during your first session. She was a member of the [[Heralds of Dust]], and she had lost her keys inside of a flesh golem and was attempting to retrieve them when you came into the room. She exclaimed that you were meant to be dead and attacked.

Notably, she had a missing jaw, replaced with translucent wax that allowed you to see the damaged part of her skull. 

The flesh golem killed Uthal, the first death of the campaign, by crushing his head into the concrete.
