You met Althax, a bariaur, in [[The Gatehouse]] after [[Pugdug]] had taken you there in an attempt to help you solve your glitch predicament. She hails from Bedlam and is an expert on the negative effects of planar magic. When you met her, she was tending to an unconscious human with a single horn sprouting from their head, with their skin warping red.

You showcased the Glitch to her by offing yourselves and by Thistle tearing chunks of his bark off, which would just glitch back. She didn't understand what afflicts you all, but theorised that the multiverse is constantly trying to erase you, and something else is constantly recreating you. You're stuck between existence and non-existence.
