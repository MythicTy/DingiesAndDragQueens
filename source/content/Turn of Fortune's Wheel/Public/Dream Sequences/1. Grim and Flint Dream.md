Augh'er awoke to hearing footsteps above him.

> "As you clearly know by now, they're in the outlands, and they've gotten a walking castle of all things. They’re keeping themselves busy helping locals, they’ve finished a drop off with a hag. That only benefits us, the more time they waste the better.”
> 
> This castle, however. It seems like their main mode of transport, so if something were to happen to it, they would be a lot less likely to keep interfering in our plans. We need to keep them in the outlands until I can find a more... permanent solution than these resplendent cages."
> 
> "You got it boss. We picked up some… ~fireworks~ from automata. I’m sure they’ll do the tricks. And- what happened in Automata was fluke, it won't happen again. It’s the big guy’s fault.” You hear a grunt in protest.
> 
> “Has Skall had any solutions by the way?"
> 
> "Not yet, though he's quite fascinated by how they are subverting the natural cycle of death. But don’t worry, if a permanent solution comes up I’ll no doubt summon you both again. It’s quite convenient when the bait is unkillable. Return to the outlands and slow them down."
> 
> "You got it boss." There's a small shuffle, as if they turned to address another. "Aight c'mon, lets get gone." You hear a grunt in agreeance, and then two sets of footsteps leave, one of the footsteps clearly walking with a metal cane.
