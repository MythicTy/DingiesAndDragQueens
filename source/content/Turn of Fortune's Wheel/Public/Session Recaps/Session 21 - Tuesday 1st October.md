We picked back up with the advent of a battle with the attackers of the castle. Zaythir stopped the tower, stuck in the cliff after it's legs were damaged. You charged out, Zaythir and Thistle in tow, to see a party of 4 moving down the cliff face.

The warlock cast Wall of Fire, hampering your charge. Uthal teleported up to the cliff to fight the Warlock just to get knocked back down the cliff. He took the wise decision to charge through, and then ate 2 5th level Hellish Rebukes from the Warlock, before getting obliterated by a Finger of Death. Despite this, you succeeded, victorious.

Uthal glitched back, so you charged onwards to see a line of 3 mortar emplacements. 2 were manned by humans in decent armour, and the other by the familiar faces of Grim and Flint. Kazaan promptly crushed Grim's head back into his body, and Uthal grappled Flint into the head of the cannon and activated it, severely damaging his hand in the process. There is still one of the Mortar Operators alive.

Whilst you fought Grim and Flint, the ground began to rumble in a familiar manner. This peaked in the landscape changing like a switch to a hellish environment. Atop the opposite hill stood a hurt pig headed demon, and a hoard of lesser Quasits and Dretches.

We pick back up with Uthal and Augh'er on death saves, clinging to life.
