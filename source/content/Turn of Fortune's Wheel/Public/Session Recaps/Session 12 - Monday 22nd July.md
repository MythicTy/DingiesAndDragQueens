You started the session by finishing off the hag, and then finishing off the other hag. You rescued the remaining children, Bawk dissolved himself, and then turned himself into a soul larva, who Thistle later popped. Bawk has now died a monumental 20 times.

After resting and recovering from the hag encounter, Augh'er experienced his first lucid dream. He heard Grim and Flint talking to an unknown voice, who talked of how "they" are in the outlands with a walking castle, and that if something were to happen to it, that would be tragic. They also commented that they needed to find something more permanent than the "Resplendent Cages", but that Skall hadn't had a solution yet. Grim and Flint left, planning to use some "fireworks".

You made it to Excelsior, where Uthal was made to confront his demons in the mosaics lining the inside of the Godstrand, leaving him at 4 levels of exhaustion. Bawk and Thistle went to the gate, filled in the Mimir, and were offered a job by Varrel, a member of the town guard, to help solve a number of disappearances. He took you all back to the town guard headquarters, which is where we pick back up.
