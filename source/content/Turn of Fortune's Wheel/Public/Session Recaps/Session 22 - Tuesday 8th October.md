'Twas a short session last. You finished off the demons that glitched into existence. You killed the Nelfeshnee faster than I thought you would, so it didn't get long to act interestingly. You had a dig through their camp, finding papers and maps tracking and logging your movements and activities as well as predicting your path of the walking castle. You also found a Pearl of Power, and 600 gold each. Of note, the camp had no signs transport, but you later learned that this was due to a nearby portal.

As a result of the glitch, the battlefield was littered with hundreds of dead and dying sunflies. Augh'er took one who was barely clinging to life and put it in a small sash, bringing it with him to hopefully heal.

You took the surviving mortar operator prisoner. Uthal interrogated him and then pushed him off the castle, murdering him. You learned that Grim and Flint had hired everyone from Automata to help hunt and collapse your walking castle.

You returned to Zaythir to learn of the damage done. One of the legs was severely damaged, require a powerful spellcaster to fix. She is also eager to see Grim and Flint brought to justice, and to help you fix whatever is going on in the Outlands as it clearly is a threat to the plane itself.

You set off to Faunel on foot. It would take you 6 days to reach, but you could do 2 days of travel in 1 at the risk of exhausting yourself due to not resting.

You began travelling the savannahs around Faunel, with the treeline to the jungles surrounding the town in the distant. The savannahs are 2 days of travel. 2 large birds flew around in the distance. Later on in the day, one of those birds began harassing you all, picking up Bawk and dropping him to his death. The bird was in search of it's eggs, stolen by some humanoids. You promised to keep your eyes out, and continued onwards, night beginning to draw close.

Unless there are objections, you begin to settle down for the night, which is where we pick back up.
