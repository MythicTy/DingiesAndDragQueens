	- See [[A Mercykiller and a Petitioner]]
# Epithet
The Mercykillers are colloquially referred to as the Jailers.
# Aligned Plane
Acheron.
# Attire
They wear bladed armour to look intimidating. Masks and hoods hide their expressions.
# Beliefs
No one is above justice. A perfect multiverse is one purged of injustice. They are ruthless, they killed their own mercy because it is an exploitable weakness. They carry out sentences despite begs and pleas. 

They don't make the laws or arrest people, they merely carry out the punishments for the verdicts passed, and occasionally track down those who have escaped.
# Politics
Work with the Harmonium and Fraternity of Order to bring criminals to justice.

They clash with factions that elevate individual freedom, such as the Hands of Havoc, Mind's Eye, and Society of Sensation.
