> The streets of the Market Ward open up into a vast, bustling plaza of chromatic tents and stalls, intertwined between permanent establishments. The sounds of sizzling foods, clanking of weaponry, and mingling of people fill your ears. Boisterous throngs of shoppers crowd the bustling avenues, doing business with vendors hailing from all corners of the multiverse. You make eye contact with a little girl, who boisterously waves and smiles at you, and then runs along.

> Scents collide in the winding stalls: warm, right angled bread loaves prepared fresh by modron bakers; spotted mushrooms hocked by bullywug grocers; and perfumed holy water sold by winged Celestials. Vibrant produce dangles from the leafy awnings of living plant stalls, and masterwork armours forged from rare metals bear insignias from blacksmiths on other worlds

> The cosmopolitan sampling of the planes and all they have to offer stands before you.

Many interesting events happening here. You started your stop with some shopping. Bawk purchased a Bag of Withholding here, alongside a Mimic Ring.
