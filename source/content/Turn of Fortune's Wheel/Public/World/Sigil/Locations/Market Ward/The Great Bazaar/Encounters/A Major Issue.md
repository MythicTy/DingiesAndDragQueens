> The crowd of people within the massive market square you find yourselves in parts like a wave as a group of lightly armored individuals march into the center of the area. The group consists of all manner of humanoids; hobgoblins and humans, dwarves and ogres. Each of them have shimmering rank insignias pinned to their chests. The command to halt is given and the member of their group leading them steps out to the side and stands before them, a hobgoblin female with her legs akimbo and hands clasped at her back. "For some of you, this is your first shore leave. I don't have to remind you, this is a privilege. We'll be returning to Rigus in 24 hours. Should you fail to return at the appointed time, you and your battle buddy will be court-martialed. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?"

> The group responds back as one forceful bark, "Ma'am, yes ma'am!"

> The leader dismisses the group and they disperse.

> The hobgoblin goes about her shopping, a sly smile of excitement on her face as she peruses the weapons on display in a nearby stall.

You met [[Major Nirra Kalar]] here. She was bringing her troop on shore leave from Rigus to shop for equipment. She recognised Uthal as he, alongside [[Grim and Flint]], attempted to extort money from her soldiers.

> The hobgoblin woman turns and does a double-take at your party and immediately starts to stride toward you, locking eyes with Uthal. "My, my. If it isn't the runt who tried to threaten my men for tax. You're lucky its busy here, because, if I remember correctly, I said I'd put my sword through your chest if I ever saw you again. Surprised you're not with your two little buddies." She puts her hand firmly and tensely on the top of your sword at her waist. "Still tempted to run you through right now, why shouldn't I?"

After talking his way out of it, she handed him a grey badge and encouraged him to stop by Rigus if he ever found himself round that way, she might have some work for him.

> "Usually I wouldn't offer the following to someone I threatened to kill, but I actually kind of like you and your gang's gall. If you find yourself needing work and are nearby Rigus, use this to get in and say you're there to talk to me. They'll let you in with no hassle... mostly". She hands you a small, grey badge with a red ribbon attached to the bottom. The badge is engraved with a sword and an axe crossing over each other.
